best and most complete Work on Gardening and Garden Plants hitherto
published. The aim is, indeed, a high one; but the Publisher, whose taste
for Flowers has rendered the production a labour of love, has, on his part,
spared no expense that the Typography and Illustrations should be of a
very high class. It is to be hoped that earnest efforts to attain accuracy, by
consulting the best Authorities, combined with no small amount of original research,
have contributed to render the <em>matter</em> of the Work not unworthy of the <em>form</em> in
which it is presented to the reader. The large number of Illustrations is an
important feature; and it is believed that the figures quoted, and the references
given to various works&mdash;in which more detailed information is contained than is
desirable, or, indeed, possible, in these pages, on account of space&mdash;will greatly add
to the interest and value of the work. Considerable trouble has been taken in
revising the tangled synonymy of many genera, and clearing up, as much as
possible, the confusion that exists in garden literature in connection with so many
plants, popular and otherwise. In the matter of generic names, Bentham and
Hooker's recently-completed "Genera Plantarum" has, with few exceptions, been
followed; that work being the one which will, for a long time to come, undoubtedly
remain the standard authority on all that relates to generic limitation. With regard
to the nomenclature of species, I have endeavoured to consult the latest and most
trustworthy Monographs and Floras, and to adopt the names in accordance with them.
Now and then, certain plants are described under their common garden names; but
they will, in such cases, be also found mentioned under the genus to which they really
belong. A case in point may be cited: <em>An≈ìctochilus Lowii</em> is given under <em>An≈ìctochilus</em>,
but the name it must now bear is <em>Dossinia</em>, and a reference to that genus
will explain matters pretty fully, as far as the present state of knowledge goes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>I am greatly indebted to Professor J. W. H. T<span class="smcapa">RAIL</span>, M.D., F.L.S., &amp;c., for
his valuable contributions on Insects, Fungi, and Diseases of Plants, branches of
science in which he has long been specially interested, and in which he is an
undoubted authority.</p>

<p>Mr. J. G<span class="smcapa">ARRETT</span>, of the Royal Gardens, Kew, late of the Royal Horticultural
Society's Gardens, is responsible for Fruit and Vegetable Culture, for most of what
appertains to Florists' Flowers, and for General Gardening Work. For information
on many special subjects&mdash;Begonias may be cited as an example&mdash;I am obliged
for much assistance to Mr. W. W<span class="smcapa">ATSON</span>, also of the Royal Gardens, Kew; in fact,
the article <em>Begonia</em>, in its entirety, was written by him. Mr. W. B. H<span class="smcapa">EMSLEY</span>, A.L.S.,
has, throughout, given me aid and advice; and I have to acknowledge constant help
from several other colleagues.</p>

<p>The Rev. P<span class="smcapa">ERCY</span> W. M<span class="smcapa">YLES</span>, M.A., has taken no little trouble in working out
the correct derivations of very many of the Generic Names; unfortunately, in a
number of instances, lack of time prevented me from obtaining the benefit of his
knowledge. I have to record my gratitude for help in so difficult a task, this
special study being one to which Mr. M<span class="smcapa">YLES</span> has paid much attention.<br /> <span class="shiftright">GEORGE NICHOLSON.</span><br /></p>

<p>It has been suggested, by an eminent Authority, that many readers would be glad
to be informed where reliable Illustrations could be found of those Plants which
are not figured in this Work. To meet this want, references to the figures

O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Caprifoliace√¶</em>. Very ornamental shrubs. Corolla
tubular, funnel-shaped, five-lobed. Leaves petiolate, dentately
crenated. Well suited for the cold greenhouse,
either as trellis or pot plants; free-flowering when well
grown, and of easy culture. May be treated in sheltered
and warm climates as hardy; and can be grown out of
doors during summer in less favoured spots. They thrive
in a compost of peat and loam in equal parts, to which a
small quantity of silver sand may be added. Increased
by cuttings in summer, and by layers in spring, under
a frame. Only two species, <em>floribunda</em> and <em>rupestris</em>,
are much grown in England.</p>

1842. The best and freest flowering evergreen species.</p>

<p><strong>A. rupestris</strong> (rock).* <em>fl.</em> sweet-scented, small, pink, in pairs at
the ends of the branches; sepals of leafy texture, with a reddish
tinge. September. <em>l.</em> small, oblong. <em>h.</em> 5ft. China, 1844. A
deciduous, branching, hairy shrub.</p>

habit of growth of the tree; or, according to some, from
<em>apios</em>, a Pear-tree, in allusion to the form of the fruit).
Spruce Fir. The synonymy of this genus is much
confused, plants belonging to several genera being frequently
referred to <em>Abies</em> in nurserymen's catalogues
and gardening periodicals. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Conifer√¶</em>. A genus of
about twenty-five species, widely distributed over the
mountainous regions of the Northern hemisphere. Cones

solitary; the carpels not thickened at the tip; and
the leaves solitary, partially scattered in insertion, and
more or less two-ranked in direction. Scales deciduous,
falling off as soon as the seed is ripe, leaving the axis on
the tree. All the species bear seeds at a comparatively
early age; most are hardy. For culture, <em>see</em> <strong>Pinus</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>

3in. to 4in. long, purple. <em>h.</em> 120ft. Japan, 1870. A recently
introduced magnificent fir, with an erect stem, regularly whorled
horizontal branches.</p>

<p><strong>A. bracteata</strong> (bracted).* <em>l.</em> rigid, linear, flat, distichous, 2in. to 3in.
long, bright glossy green above, and glaucous beneath. <em>cones</em>
about 4in. long, with the bracts developed into long rigid leaf-like
linear spines, 2in. long, and slightly curved inwards. <em>h.</em> 25ft.
Southern California, 1853. A very handsome tall slender tree,
but, owing to its very early growth of new shoots, it is much
injured by the spring frosts.</p>

<p><strong>A. Brunoniana</strong> (Brown's). Synonymous with <em>Tsuga Brunoniana</em>.</p>

<p><strong>A. canadensis</strong> (Canadian). A synonym of <em>Tsuga canadensis</em>.</p>

<p><strong>A. cilicica</strong> (Cilician). <em>l.</em> linear, slightly curved or straight, 1in.
to 1¬Ωin. long, dark green above, and glaucous beneath, crowded, in
two ranks. <em>cones</em> cylindrical, 6in. to 8in. long; scales broad, thin,
entire, coriaceous. <em>h.</em> 40ft. to 60ft. Mount Taurus, in Asia
Minor. This species seldom produces a good specimen tree in
England, and cannot, therefore, be recommended for general
cultivation.</p>

<p><strong>A. concolor</strong> (one-coloured).* <em>l.</em> linear, flat, obtuse, glaucous green,
distichously arranged in double rows, those in the lower rows 2in.
to 3in. long, upper ones shorter, channelled above. <em>cones</em> cylindrical,
obtuse both at base and top, 3in. to 5in. long, 2in. to 2¬Ωin.

protruding keeled bracts. <em>h.</em> 100ft. Japan, 1861. An erect tree,
of great beauty.</p>

<p><strong>A. Fortunei</strong> (Fortune's). It is said that in its native country, its
aspect is peculiar rather than handsome, and that but one living
representative is believed to be in existence in this country&mdash;at
Veitch's Nursery. S<span class="smcapa">YN</span>. <em>Keteleeria Fortunei</em>.</p>

<p><strong>A. Fraseri</strong> (Fraser's). Double Balsam Spruce Fir. <em>l.</em> linear,
emarginate, silvery beneath. <em>cones</em> oblong, squarrose, somewhat
leafy, obcordate, mucronate, half exserted, reflexed. <em>h.</em> 30ft. to
40ft. North Carolina, 1811. This species closely resembles <em>A.
balsamea</em>, from which it differs in having shorter and more erect
leaves, and smaller cones.</p>

<p><strong>A. grandis</strong> (splendid).* <em>l.</em> in double rows, on each side of the
branchlets, flat, obtuse, emarginate, pectinate, silvery beneath,
from ¬æin. to 1in. long. <em>cones</em> lateral, solitary, cylindrical, obtuse

growth.</p>

<p><strong>A. lasiocarpa</strong> (woolly-coned). Synonymous with <em>A. concolor</em>.</p>

<p><strong>A. magnifica</strong> (magnificent).* <em>l.</em> densely crowded, two-rowed, 1in.
to nearly 2in. long, olive green, very glaucous on the upper
surface when young, becoming duller with age, and marked with
two silvery lines beneath. <em>cones</em> 6in. to 7in. long, 2¬Ωin. to 3in. in
diameter; scales, outer edge incurved. <em>h.</em> 200ft. North California,
1851. A very tall and stately species, with, at successive intervals,
whorls of horizontal branches.</p>

<p><strong>A. Mariesii</strong> (Maries'). <em>l.</em> erect, evenly disposed around the stem,

without the bractea, 1¬ºin. long, and the same in breadth; bractea
spathulate, imbricated backwards, ‚Öùin. long. <em>h.</em> 200ft. to 300ft.
California, 1831. A majestic tree.</p>

<p><strong>A. Nordmanniana</strong> (Nordmann's).* <em>l.</em> linear, rigid, flat, and
minutely bifid at the apex, on young trees spreading in two rows,
with a half-twist at the base, 1in. long. <em>cones</em> erect, slightly ovoid,
pedunculate, 4in. to 6in. long, and 2¬ºin. to 2¬æin. wide; bracts
large, coriaceous, three-lobed, fringed, greatly exceeding the
scales. <em>h.</em> 80ft. to 100ft. Crimea, &amp;c., 1848. A magnificent and
stately tree, of regular growth.</p>

<p><strong>A. Numidica</strong> (Numidian). Synonymous with <em>A. baborensis</em>.</p>

<p><strong>A. obovata</strong> (reversed-egg-coned). A synonym of <em>Picea obovata</em>.</p>

1¬Ωin. to 2in. broad, when ripe, brown; scales with a long dorsal
bractea, 1/6in. to 1¬ºin. long, and 1¬ºin. broad. <em>h.</em> 80ft. to 100ft. A
very noble silver fir, of slow growth when young only. Central
Europe, 1603. There are several unimportant varieties of this
splendid species.</p>

<p><strong>A. Pindrow</strong> (Pindrow). In its native home, the Himalayas, this
is a very beautiful tree, attaining the height of 150ft., but it has
generally failed in England, in consequence of our late spring
frosts destroying the young growth. It comes very near <em>A.

<p><a name="ABUTILON" id="ABUTILON"></a><strong>ABUTILON</strong> (Arabic name for a plant analogous to

and free-growing shrubs, both for the greenhouse
and outside culture. Calyx naked, five-cleft, usually
angular; style multifid at apex. The many beautiful
hybrids (of which Fig. 2 represents a group) now
in cultivation, far supersede the true species. Cultivation:
Few plants are more easily grown and worthy
of liberal treatment than these. The best soil for them
is equal parts turfy loam, peat, and leaf mould, with
some gritty sand. They may either be grown in pots, or
planted out; but in all cases thorough drainage is indispensable,
as they require an abundance of water, and stagnancy
must be guarded against. At the end of May they
may be planted outside, when they will flower profusely
through the summer. In a free growing and flowering state
they enjoy weak manure water. From the latter part of
autumn till early spring they may be kept almost dry without
injury, though in a warm conservatory some of the later
struck plants will go on flowering throughout the greater
part of the winter; or plants may be specially prepared
for winter flowering. They are admirably adapted for
forming standards of various heights, from 2ft. to 6ft.
Some of the taller sorts are very useful for training under
roof rafters. As pillar plants, too, very loosely trained, so
as to allow the upper and side branches to droop to a considerable
distance from the pillar, they are very effective.
Propagation: They strike readily from cuttings made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of the young wood, at almost any season; the best time,
however, is early spring and September. Inserted in pots,
in a compost of equal parts peat, leaf mould, loam, and
sand, and placed in a temperature of from 65deg. to 70deg.,
they will then quickly root, and form good plants. Seeds
may be sown in pans filled with soil as recommended for
cuttings, and placed in a similar temperature. Those followed
by a dagger (‚Ä†) are the best for training to pillars,
roofs, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="ACACIA" id="ACACIA"></a><a name="ACACIAB" id="ACACIAB"></a><strong>ACACIA</strong> (from <em>ac</em>, a point, in Celtic; or from <em>akazo</em>,
to sharpen; many of the species are furnished with
spines). <em>See</em> also <a href="#ALBIZZIAA"><em>Albizzia</em></a>. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Leguminos√¶</em>. Shrubs or
trees, very variable in habit and leaves. Flowers yellow,
white, rarely red, disposed in globular heads or spikes,
decandrous or polyandrous. Spines stipular, scattered, or
wanting. This is a very polymorphous genus, and the
majority of species described are known in this country
only from herbarium specimens. It is very doubtful
whether the entire genus is represented in our gardens
by more than about fifty species, many of which are only
to be found in botanic gardens; but this number is,
without doubt, sufficiently characteristic. The number
of species is close upon 400, and the genus one
of the largest known. In our enumeration, we have
strictly confined ourselves to describing such as are unquestionably
in cultivation, and to this end we have adopted
the only accurate method of deciding which are and which
are not grown, viz., by consulting the trade lists of nurserymen,
both in this country and on the Continent. Such
lists, however, are not always correct, from a scientific
point of view, in the matter of nomenclature. The
species best deserving of cultivation are all natives of
Australia, New South Wales, or other temperate regions,
and are among the hardiest and most easily cultivated of
all greenhouse plants. They are very floriferous. The
greenhouse species are sufficiently hardy to withstand the
winter in a temperature very little higher than freezing
point. Cultivation: Some have a tendency to make long
straight shoots; these should be selected for training upon
rafters or pillars, on which they thrive well and form
splendid ornaments in spring; whilst the more shrubby
kinds will be equally at home in pots in the form of bushes.
Roots and tops grow with great rapidity, and an abundance
of water is required at all times. Immediately after flowering
(usually about May) is the best time to prune Acacias;
they may then be placed in the open air, and fully exposed
to the sun, until October. They make a far healthier,
cleaner growth, and ripen their wood much better outside
than under glass; all they require is copious waterings,
never allowing them to become dry, and keeping clear of
weeds. In the first week in October house the plants, and
winter in a temperature of 40deg. to 50deg. They delight
in a light rich compost of equal parts turfy loam and leaf
mould, freely intermixed with sand, or peat may be used
instead of the leaf mould. Propagation: Cuttings of the
half-ripened wood, put in with a heel, root readily during
the summer. They do not bear heat well, nor do they
require it. The soil should be equal parts peat and sand,
covered with pure sand, thoroughly consolidated. Insert
the cuttings as soon as made; water home, and leave them
in the shade till dry. Then place the bell glasses over
them, shade and water so as to prevent flagging. Pot off
as soon as rooted, and keep in a close pit or house until
the plants are thoroughly established. Seeds should be
sown as soon as ripe, in sandy peat; about ¬ºin. deep, or
a little more, for large seeds. A temperature of 55deg.
to 60deg. suits them well. Pot off when large enough
to handle, and place in a cool close pit or house until quite
established. The culture and propagation of the stove
species are the same as for the greenhouse sorts, but the
former require, of course, greater heat. Their flowers, however,
are much less frequently produced than their more
temperate congeners, consequently they are not so much
grown.</p>

A group of stately, ornamental perennial plants, mostly
hardy, remarkable for their vigorous growth and beautiful
foliage. Flowers sessile, crowded, spicate; corolla tubular,
one-lipped; lip three lobed. To attain perfection they
require a deep soil, and a situation fully exposed to the

common soil and partial shade. The habit being generally
a bold one, they are most suited for isolated tufts,
backgrounds of mixed borders, and the wild garden.
Propagated by seeds, sown in gentle heat, or by division

for the most part, of handsome hardy deciduous
shrubs, or trees, adapted for forming shrubberies,
plantations, &amp;c. Flowers greenish, except where mentioned.
<em>A. Pseudo-platanus</em> is one of our most useful
forest trees. Several of the species produce very useful
timber; sugar is one of the constituent parts of the sap of
all of them, and is obtained in large quantities from <em>A.
saccharinum</em>, in North America. They all prefer a somewhat
sheltered position. The most satisfactory soil is
one free, deep, loamy, and well drained; the latter is
especially desirable with some of the Japanese varieties.
The varieties of <em>A. japonicum</em>, and <em>palmatum</em> are well
worth growing in pots for conservatory decoration. Propagation:
By seeds, sown either in autumn or spring,
covering them not more than a ¬ºin. deep; the common
varieties may be sown outside, while the rarer ones should
be sown in a frame. By layers, and by grafting; the
latter method is adopted with many of the rarer species
and varieties, especially the variegated kinds; they are
also readily increased by budding in summer.</p>

<p>To be successfully cultivated, they must be started and
grown in stove heat till they commence flowering, when
they may be removed to the conservatory or greenhouse,
there to remain till after flowering. Batches of tubercles
should be started in heat from February till the end of
April, so as to give a succession of blossom. Shake each
variety out of the old compost and insert separately in
light, sandy soil; water sparingly at first, but when active
they may receive more frequent supplies. When the shoots
are about 2in. high, the tubercles may be transplanted
to the pots, pans, or baskets in which it is intended to grow
them, using as potting compost fibrous peat and leaf-soil
in equal proportions, with about a sixth part of sheep's
or rotten cow manure, and sufficient silver sand to make
the whole porous and of a whitish appearance. Thorough
drainage is indispensable, and a layer of the rougher soil,
or sphagnum, should be placed over the potsherds, to prevent
the loose soil stopping the drainage. Place the pans
as near the glass as possible, and shade from bright sunshine.
Give liberal supplies of water, with occasional
doses of liquid manure; and, as the shoots lengthen, they
may be pinched, to induce sturdy growth and a larger
number of flowering branches. Place neat stakes to each
stem, and keep well tied, arranging the stakes as symmetrically
as possible, so as to ensure an even outline, but
do not allow them to be seen. Light syringing with clear
water, morning and evening, is beneficial. After the plants
have done flowering, they should gradually have less water
as the foliage and stems decay; a light airy situation
is needed to mature and ripen the tubers. When the
tops are quite dead, they may be removed, and the
pots stored on the sides in any warm dry corner where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the temperature will not fall below 50deg., keeping the
plants quite dry until the time of starting again. Achimenes
are liable to attacks of thrips, red-spider, and green-fly,
especially if the atmosphere is kept dry; these are easily
destroyed by fumigation with tobacco. This must only be
done when the foliage is quite dry, otherwise the plants will
suffer. Achimenes are especially beautiful when well
arranged, especially if two or three varieties are mixed
together, as white, red, and purple (Fig. 15). There are
several methods of increasing these:&mdash;(1) By cuttings;
these need not be cut off at a joint, as they will root from
any portion of the stem. Insert them thickly in well-drained
pots of sandy soil&mdash;say a mixture of equal parts of
peat and sand&mdash;and place in bottom heat. (2) By leaves,
which should be severed from the stems, and pricked in
pots of similar soil to the cuttings, placing all the petiole
below the surface; stand the pots in bottom heat. (3) By
scales from the corms, which should be carefully rubbed off
and sown, like seeds, in pots or pans of the same compost,
barely covered with sand, and placed in bottom heat.
(4) By seeds, which are very small, and, consequently,
require to be carefully sown. The pans must be thoroughly
drained and filled nearly to the rim, levelled, and well
watered with a fine rose, after which the seed should be
thinly scattered, covered very lightly with sand, and placed
in a shady position. Keep nicely moist, and apply water
very lightly, or the tiny germs will be disturbed. Place a
sheet of glass over the seed-pans. When the seedlings are
large enough to handle, they may be pricked off and afterwards
treated like rooted cuttings. The best time for all
modes of propagating is early spring.</p>

<p><a name="ACINETA" id="ACINETA"></a><strong>ACINETA</strong> (from <em>akineta</em>, immovable; the lip being
jointless). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Orchide√¶</em>. A small genus of cool house,
robust, sub-terrestrial orchids allied to <em>Peristeria</em>. Flowers
sub-globose, fleshy, arranged on stout, pendulous racemes.
Leaves lanceolate, membranous, ribbed. Pseudo-bulbs
angular, about as large as hens' eggs. The compost should
consist of equal parts of fibrous peat and living sphagnum.
In planting, first place a somewhat thick layer of the moss
all round the inside of the basket, and press the soil firmly
round the plant. During the growing season, the baskets
should be taken down twice or three times a week and
dipped into a tub of water, so that the whole may become
saturated. In addition, the plants should be sprinkled
with the syringe morning and evening, for they delight in
an abundant supply of water and plenty of shade. When
the growth is finished, they must be kept very dry, an
occasional syringing, to keep the leaves from shrivelling,
being all that is necessary.</p>

Aconite; Monk's Hood; Wolf's Bane. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Ranunculace√¶</em>.
An extensive genus of very ornamental hardy perennials.
Flowers in terminal racemes; sepals five, the upper one
helmet shaped, the two sides broader than the two back
ones; petals five, small, the two upper with long claws
hooded at the tip; the three inferior smaller or undeveloped.
Leaves palmate. They thrive well in any ordinary garden
soil. If left undisturbed for several years, they will attain
a goodly size, and produce fine panicles of handsome flowers.
They are invaluable for growing beneath the shade of trees,
where they succeed better than almost any other class of
plants. All are very easily propagated by divisions of the
roots and seeds; the latter should be sown as soon as ripe
in a cold frame. Care should be taken not to leave pieces
of the roots about, for, with but one exception, those of all
the species are very poisonous. Although very unlike
horse-radish, they have frequently been mistaken for it, with
fatal results; and none of the species should be cultivated
in or near the kitchen garden.</p>

There are a great number of varieties of this species cultivated
and introduced. The following are some of the names representing
slightly varying forms which have, however, been
regarded as species by Reichenbach and other authors: <em>acutum</em>,
<em>am≈ìnum</em>, <em>Bernhardianum</em>, <em>Braunii</em>, <em>callibotryon</em>, <em>Clusianum</em>, <em>commutatum</em>,
<em>firmum</em>, <em>formosum</em>, <em>Funkianum</em>, <em>hians</em>, <em>Hoppeanum</em>,

<em>neomontanum</em>, <em>neubergense</em>, <em>oligocarpus</em>, <em>rigidum</em>, <em>strictum</em>, <em>tenuifolium</em>,
<em>venustum</em>, <em>virgatum</em>. One of the most virulent of
poisonous plants, both to cattle as well as human beings; and,
notwithstanding its eminently handsome appearance, it should
only be planted in places where no danger is likely to arise from
its presence. See Figs. 17 and 18.</p>

usually aggregate leaves, having petiolar stipulas, and
complicated leaflets. All the species are elegant when
in flower, and well suited for ornamenting the fronts
of shrubberies. Except where otherwise mentioned, all
are hardy. They thrive best in a mixture of loam, peat,

or by grafting the rarer on the commoner kinds. Young
cuttings will root freely in sand, covered by a hand glass,
which should be taken off and wiped occasionally. Seeds
may be sown in March, the hardy species out of doors, and
the others in a cold house.</p>

<p><a name="AECHMEA" id="AECHMEA"></a><strong>√ÜCHMEA</strong> (from <em>aichme</em>, a point; in reference to the
rigid points on the calyces, or flower-envelopes). Including
<em>Pironneaua</em>. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Bromeliace√¶</em>. Very handsome stove
plants. Flowers scapose, panicled; perianth six-cleft, three
outer segments sepaloid, longer than the three inner or
petaloid ones. Leaves ligulate or sword-shaped, sometimes
with marginal spines. The species thrive best in a well-drained
compost of rich fibrous loam and leaf mould.
They like plenty of light, which may be afforded by
standing them on inverted pots, so as to raise their
heads well up above the surrounding plants. Propagation:
When the flower-spikes, which are sent up from the heart
or crown of the plant, die away, suckers or offsets are
produced near the base, and from these other flowers
appear the year after. If large plants are desired, these
suckers should be left to grow and spread around; but to
produce single plants, the suckers must be taken off and
potted singly, in sharp soil, and then stood where they can
get a moist heat till rooted. To enable them to do this it
is necessary to strip off a few of the lower leaves, and trim
the bottom with a sharp knife, in order that it may heal
over and callus more readily than it otherwise would.
When rooted, the plants may be shifted into larger-sized
pots; but for single crowns 32-sized pots are large
enough, as the plants, being epiphytal in their nature,
do not require much soil or any great supply of water,
except when growing freely or sending up their flower-spikes.
In winter, they should be kept rather on the dry
side, to induce partial rest; and an important point is to
see that water is not allowed to lie for any length of time
in the crown of the plant, as when that is the case it is
likely to cause them to rot.</p>

<p><a name="AERIDES" id="AERIDES"></a><strong>AERIDES</strong> (from <em>aer</em>, the air; in reference to the
power the species have of deriving their sustenance from
the atmosphere). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Orchide√¶</em>. An extensive genus of
epiphytal orchids, confined to the tropics of the Old World,
including many large and showy-flowered species. The
majority of them are extremely handsome. The thick fleshy
leaves are noteworthy for their characteristically distichous
arrangement&mdash;that is to say, they are arranged in two
opposite rows. They are usually truncate at the apex, and
for the most part deeply channelled down the centre, but in
some species terete or nearly cylindrical. All of them throw
out large fleshy roots from various parts of their stems, by
which they absorb the moisture from the atmosphere; and,
in order to grow them successfully, they must be fixed upon
blocks of wood. But this method should be adopted only
whilst the plants are young, as it is almost an impossibility
for the cultivator to maintain a sufficient amount of atmospheric
moisture to meet their requirements; and, unless
this is managed, the leaves will shrivel and fall off, leaving
only a few at the extremity. Therefore, as soon as the
plants are established upon the blocks of wood, let them
be removed and potted. Fill the pot three parts full of
broken potsherds and lumps of charcoal, and then use
nothing, but clean, living sphagnum, placing a few roots in
the moss and leaving the others free. By this means a
greater amount of moisture can be supplied to them, and
thus beautiful and symmetrical specimens obtained. The
Aerides are easily grown into handsome plants, which
usually bloom profusely, and thus recommend themselves
to all who cultivate orchids. From early spring until
the end of September they should be treated liberally with
water, at the same time taking care never to wet the
flowers. After the above-named time, a gradual diminution
in the water supply to the roots should take place; and
the atmosphere, too, should be less densely charged with
moisture. But drought should never be carried far enough
to cause the leaves to shrivel, for, if this is done, the uniformity
of the specimen is marred; and, although we are
quite willing to admit the possibility of the plants producing
a greater quantity of flower spikes after a thorough
shrivelling, we prefer to advocate the system that gives a
fair amount of flower coupled with good leafage. As before
remarked, the Aerides are peculiarly eastern, and therefore
are usually classed amongst the orchids which require the
hottest houses. This is, in one sense, correct; yet they do
not require the great amount of heat which many imagine,
and which has, until recently, been given them. They
must not, therefore, be excluded from the amateur's collection
of orchids. During the winter season many of the
species may be kept in a temperature of 58deg. to 60deg.;
whilst during the growing season the temperature may run
up by sun heat without limit, so long as a free circulation
of air and a sufficiency of moisture are secured. The
following status of temperature may be observed: In spring,
from 65deg. in the night, to 70deg. or 80deg. by day; in
summer, from 70deg. in the night, to 80deg. or 85deg.
through the day; in winter, about 60deg. night, and 65deg.

form, and have the segments tipped with rich purple or amethyst,
the centre or throat of the flower being ivory-white. Compared
with <em>A. falcatum</em>, the spur is here bent under at an angle, while
in that plant it is straight; the side lacini√¶ of the lip are much
broader and shorter in the present plant, and the two keels on the
lip here stand close together at the base, and become divergent,
whilst in <em>falcatum</em> they are distant at the base, and become convergent
near the middle of the lip. This species is described as
being the best in the genus. It may be grown near the glass,
suspended in a basket. Burmah, 1877.</p></blockquote>

<p><a name="AESCHYNANTHUS" id="AESCHYNANTHUS"></a><strong>√ÜSCHYNANTHUS</strong> (from <em>aischuno</em>, to be ashamed,
and <em>anthos</em>, a flower). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Gesnerace√¶</em>. A genus of very
beautiful twining, radicant or parasitical
stove shrubs, with opposite,
simple, entire leaves, and axillary,
terminal, few flowered, umbellate peduncles.
They possess all the qualifications
worthy of extensive cultivation&mdash;handsome
flowers, fine deep
green leaves, an agreeable fragrance,
and are easily grown on blocks, which
must be covered with green moss,
fastened on with small copper wire.
Preparatory to fastening them on,
the roots should be covered with moss,
and the plants secured to the block
also by wire. After this, but little attention
is requisite, except duly syringing
and occasionally dipping in tepid
water. As pot plants they are very
beautiful, and in this method perfection
is only obtained by growing them on
fast and strong by generous treatment,
which consists in frequently repotting
in light rich compost till they are
large enough to be trained up a trellis, formed of slender
rods of willow or hazel. Propagated by seeds and cuttings.
The former are very unsatisfactory; the latter root readily
during spring in a well-drained pot, filled with a light compost,
and having a surface of pure white sand, about 1in.
deep. The best are obtained from half-ripened wood, cut
into 2in. or 3in. lengths, and all leaves, with the exception
of one or two at the top, removed. The cuttings should then
be covered over with a bell glass, and placed in moderate
bottom heat. So soon as rooted, transfer them singly to
small pots, and again place under hand glasses, until they
are thoroughly established, then gradually harden off.
When about twelve months old, place the plants in their
permanent quarters. Baskets are commonly and very
effectively employed. Line these with moss, and fill with
a light rich compost; place the plant as near the centre
as possible, and, to promote a uniform growth, fasten down
the branches with small neat pegs, at equal distances.
During the summer, give copious supplies of water, to
produce a liberal growth, which is of the utmost importance
the first season, when they should not be permitted to
flower. The following winter they should be kept cool
and rather dry, thus giving them a rest. The year
following, if properly managed, they will bloom profusely.</p>

herbaceous plants. Flowers large, scapose;
perianth tubular, tube short; stamens six, having the
filaments somewhat declinate. Leaves linear or lorate,
arching, radical. They are of easy culture, and thrive
best in strong turfy loam, leaf mould, decomposed manure,
and river sand. They may be grown in large pots or tubs
outside, to be removed in autumn, and placed under the
stage in the greenhouse, or where they will be protected
from frost, and kept moderately dry. If planted and left
outside, the crowns should be well covered with cocoa-nut
fibre in winter. During the summer, and especially in dry
weather, the plants can hardly be over watered. They
thrive admirably on the margins of lakes or running
streams, and few plants, alike in flower and foliage, are
more effective. Clear manure water may be given previous
to or when the plants are in flower, and, after
flowering, gradually lessen the quantity of water, until
they are stowed away for the winter. They increase very
rapidly, by offsets, and, if necessary, the old plants may be
divided in early spring, to any extent required. In the
more southern parts of this country they are quite hardy.</p>

<p><a name="AGAVE" id="AGAVE"></a><strong>AGAVE</strong> (from <em>agauos</em>, admirable; referring to the
stately form in which some of them flower). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Amaryllidace√¶</em>.
Flower-scape tall, proceeding from the centre of the
rosette of leaves; perianth funnel-shaped, six-parted. Leaves
large, fleshy, tufted. Mr. B. S. Williams describes them as
follows: "They are noble, massive-growing plants, and form
magnificent ornaments in the greenhouse or conservatory;
whilst, from their slow growth, they do not rapidly get too
large, even for a small greenhouse. Indeed, some of the
real gems of this genus are neat, compact-growing plants,
seldom exceeding 2ft. in height. Besides being fine ornamental
plants for indoor decoration, the larger growing
kinds are unquestionably the finest objects for the embellishment
of terrace-walks, or surmounting flights of steps
in the open air during the summer season, and also for
plunging in rockwork, or about any rustic nooks in the
pleasure-grounds, as, in such situations, they are quite in
keeping, and thrive admirably. As is well known, they
attain maturity very slowly; but when this condition is
reached, the plant sends up a flower spike, and, after
perfecting this, dies." <em>A. Sartorii</em>, and a few others are,
however, exceptional, and go on flowering year after year.
It is certainly fallacious to suppose it takes them a hundred
years to flower. Agaves succeed well potted in good
loam and river sand, to which may be added a little peat and
leaf mould for some of the smaller-growing kinds. The
drainage should be good, as they enjoy a liberal supply
of water during the summer season, but during winter
considerably less will be required. They can be increased
by suckers when these are to be obtained, and also by
seeds, to secure the production of which, in the species
that do not yield suckers, the flowers should be carefully
impregnated. In the following descriptive list
of species, only those of horticultural value are mentioned,
some of which are still rare; and in describing
them we have availed ourselves of Mr. J. G. Baker's
excellent monograph, which appeared in the columns
of the <em>Gardener's Chronicle</em>. Many are omitted, not
from any deficiency in horticultural beauty, but because,
in several instances, only one plant of a species is known to
exist in cultivation, and such cannot, therefore, hope to
become in general cultivation for many years hence.</p>

<p><a name="AGERATUM" id="AGERATUM"></a><strong>AGERATUM</strong> (from <em>a</em>, not, and <em>geras</em>, old; in reference
to the flowers being always clear). S<span class="smcapa">YN</span>. <em>C≈ìlestina</em>. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>.
<em>Composit√¶</em>. This genus includes several American species,
for the most part half-hardy annuals and biennials; or, if
the seed is not allowed to ripen, they become perennials.
Involucre cup-shaped, of many imbricated linear bracts; receptacle
naked. Leaves opposite. A light rich soil is most
suitable. Very easily increased by cuttings or seeds; if
required true, the former is the only sure method of propagation.
To grow large plants for greenhouse decoration,
sow the seeds in January, in heat, in sandy soil,
barely covering them. As soon as the young plants are
large enough, prick them off into thumb pots, and keep
in heat till they grow freely, then place them into a
cooler house. Transfer into larger pots as soon as the
others are full of roots, until they are finally shifted into
10in. or 12in. pots. When these are full of roots, the
plants should be watered with liquid manure twice a week,
and they soon flower well, making fine specimens. During
hot weather especially, they should be well syringed
with clear water daily, to keep down red spider. The
plants required for bedding (for which purpose the dwarf
garden varieties are mostly used) should be raised about
the same time, kept in small pots, gradually hardened off,
and planted out in the middle or end of June. Cuttings
of all the varieties strike readily in heat, treated like most
soft-wooded plants, and, when rooted, may be managed as
recommended for the seedlings.</p>

<p><a name="ALLAMANDA" id="ALLAMANDA"></a><strong>ALLAMANDA</strong> (named in memory of Dr. Allamand,
of Leyden, who first communicated seeds of this genus to
Linn√¶us). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Apocynace√¶</em>. Elegant climbing evergreen
stove plants. Peduncles terminal and many-flowered;
corolla funnel-shaped, with a narrow tube, gamopetalous,
large, inflated, five-cleft at the apex. Leaves verticillate.
This genus differs from all others of the same order, in the
figure of the corolla. Of comparatively easy culture. To
obtain their beauty of foliage and flowers, the shoots
should be tied to wires placed within 8in. or 9in. of the
glass that forms the roof of the structure in which the
plants are growing. Trained in this way, and the shoots
allowed to ramble in a somewhat natural manner, the effect,
when the plants are in flower, is grander and more pleasing
in every respect than when the shoots are tied to a formal
trellis, of whatever shape. When thoroughly established,
they succeed admirably in a compost of three parts good
fibry loam, and one part wood charcoal or coarse river
sand, with some rotten cow manure added. When potting
the plants, make the fresh compost firm round the old
balls of soil, and do not fill the pots too full; leave
room for plenty of water, as, when in active growth, they
require a liberal daily supply. They must be pruned
annually in January or February, cutting the previous
year's shoots back to within a joint or two of the old wood.
Allamandas should be exposed to the light as much as possible
at all seasons of the year. In winter months they
require but little water, but the drainage must always be
perfect. They are remarkably free from insect attacks of
any kind. It may be also observed that the temperature
should never fall below 55deg. This genus is easily propagated
by cuttings, which will root at any time of the
year in a bottom heat of from 70deg. to 80deg. The usual
time is, however, in spring, when the old plants are pruned
back. Choose the tops of the shoots, retaining two or
three joints to each cutting; place these in a compost
of sand and peat or leaf mould in equal proportions,
singly, in small pots. Press the soil firmly around
each cutting, and, when all are inserted, give a good
watering, and plunge the pots in the propagating bed.
Attend to shading and watering, and in about three
weeks' time they will have emitted roots, and started to
grow at the tops. The pots should now be raised out of
the plunging material, and placed upon the surface thereof,
and there allowed to remain two or three weeks longer;
when the young roots will have, by this time, filled the
little pots, and a shift into the larger ones will be necessary.
Return the plants to the propagating bed, but do not
plunge them therein. As soon as it is certain that the roots
have commenced growth in the fresh soil, pinch the point
of each plant that is intended to be grown on a trellis. This
will cause the remaining buds to push out fresh shoots;
and these, as soon as they have made two joints or
whorls of leaves each, should have their points pinched out
also. By repotting the plants as often as they fill their
pots with roots during the first season of their growth, and
pinching the points out of the shoots twice or thrice in the
same time, a good foundation will be formed, from which
the future specimens will spring. In the case of plants
intended to be trained up rafters or pillars, they should
not have their points pinched out until they attain to the
height where it is desirable they should have more than
one shoot, and be repotted as recommended above, for
the first year; but, after that, they will require to be
repotted only once a year, and this should be done soon
after the buds have started to grow afresh in the
spring.</p>

to the same occupier, provided his character has been satisfactory
during the preceding year.</p>

<p>3. The rent shall be considered due at Michaelmas. If it
remains unpaid for one month after that date, the Allotment
shall be forfeited.</p>

<p>4. The Allotment to be cultivated solely by spade husbandry,
and the same crop shall not be planted on the
same part two years in succession.</p>

<p>5. Separate Allotments shall be divided by a space not
less than 18in.</p>

or in any way interfering or damaging the same, shall not be
allowed to hold his Allotment after the expiration of the year.</p>

<em>Betulace√¶</em>. A genus of deciduous trees and shrubs.
Flowers mon≈ìcious; barren ones in long drooping autumnal
catkins, lasting through the winter; fertile
ones, produced in spring, in oval catkins, resembling
a fir-cone in shape, the fleshy scales of which become
indurated and ligneous as they approach maturity.
Leaves stalked, roundish, blunt. Propagated usually by
seeds, which are gathered towards the end of October; they
require to be well dried, in order that the cones do not
become mouldy. The seeds are sprinkled lightly on the
ground with the slightest possible covering. Towards the
end of the year, the seedlings will be about 10in. high.
They are then planted in rows 1¬Ωft. apart, and 6in. from
each other, where they may remain for two years, after
which they can be placed out in the situations where they
are intended to stand. Planting is best done in November
or March; and, if it is designed to make a plantation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>

suckers, and by grafting.</p>

the bulbs and soil raised well above the rim of the pots,

genus, and its allies, have been completely revised by Mr.
J. G. Baker (<em>vide</em> "Journal of the Linnean Society,"
vol. xxviii. pp. 152-182), to whose account we are indebted
for many of the following particulars:&mdash;Plant with
or without stems; shrubs or (rarely) trees; leaves thick,
fleshy, frequently in a rosette; peduncles simple or racemed,
endowed with few or many empty bracts. Flowers racemed;
pedicels bracteated at base, solitary; perianth-tube straight
or slightly recurved; segments elongated; stamens hypogynous,
as long as the perianth, or longer. Mr. Baker
describes over eighty species, many of which, for various
and important reasons, have no claim upon our space.
Natives of the Cape of Good Hope, except where otherwise
stated. These very interesting and curious plants thrive
well in a mixture of open loam and peat, together with a
small quantity of well decomposed manure. If old brick
rubbish, or any other similar material is mixed with the
soil to ensure perfect and rapid drainage, so much the
better. Water, especially during winter, must be carefully
administered. They thrive in an ordinary greenhouse, and
cannot have too much light at any time.</p>

O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Verbenace√¶</em>. This genus is nearly allied to <em>Verbena</em>,
which <em>see</em> for generic characters. A greenhouse deciduous
shrub, with a very fine perfume and graceful habit. The
most satisfactory plan of culture is to obtain well-grown
thrifty young plants in spring, and grow them on for the
season. As the wood ripens, give less water until they are
at rest, when it must be nearly withheld. About the end of
January, bring into the light and warmth, and water
thoroughly. As soon as the plants break, cut back to three
or four eyes; and when the young shoots are about an inch
long, transfer into rich sandy soil, using pots a size or two
smaller than those they were in before. When the pots are
full of roots, transfer to those that are to hold the plants for
the season. By this mode of culture, good plants are to be
maintained for any length of time. Aloysias form excellent
pillar subjects for either a cold greenhouse, or out-of-doors,
in which latter situation they thrive remarkably
well, but require thorough protection, with straw bands
or mats, from November until March, and afterwards at
night, until danger from severe frosts has passed. They
require no summer training, their young growth being continually
cut off for the many purposes of decoration to
which they are applied, and to which they are so well
adapted. They are easily increased by young cuttings in
spring, which should be placed in sandy soil and gentle
heat, when they will root in about three weeks.</p>

<p><a name="ALPINE_GARDEN" id="ALPINE_GARDEN"></a><strong>ALPINE GARDEN.</strong> A very interesting style of
gardening, which succeeds best by imitating Nature as closely
as possible. The situation may be an open or a sheltered
one. In building a Rock or Alpine Garden, it should be so
arranged that all aspects are secured&mdash;shady and sunny&mdash;fully
or in degree only. Pockets and crevices of various
sizes may be made, and filled with soil suitable for the subjects
to be planted therein, each one having a direct connection
with the bulk of the soil; and the constructing material
should be arranged with a gentle fall, so that moisture
drains towards rather than from the roots. Alpine plants,
as a rule, flourish better on a properly constructed rockery
than if placed in any other position, because thorough
drainage is effected, and the long and fine roots can
run down in the crevices, where the soil is cool and
moist. Although most alpine plants are naturally exposed
to the full action of sun and wind, they should be placed out
in early autumn, or early spring, so as to become thoroughly
established before the approach of scorching summer
weather. Failing materials necessary for the construction
of a rockery, many alpines are easily grown in the
ordinary border, in a naturally or artificially well drained
situation. Excavate to the depth of 18in., put in a layer
of stones, broken bricks, &amp;c., 6in. deep; fill up with rich
fibrous loam and leaf mould, adding sufficient sand to keep
the soil porous. When the desired subjects are firmly
planted, cover the surface with small gravel or stone
chippings, which, while allowing the rain to penetrate the
soil, effectually checks evaporation, and keeps it moist and
cool, as well as giving the appearance of rocky <em>d√©bris</em>. The
effect will be better if the surface is slightly undulated.</p>

<p><a name="ALPINIA" id="ALPINIA"></a><strong>ALPINIA</strong> (in honour of Prosper Alpinus, an Italian
botanist). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Zingiberace√¶</em>. A rather large genus of
stove herbaceous perennials, with considerable grace and
beauty. Flowers disposed in terminal spikes. Leaves
lanceolate, smooth, even, entire, sheathed at the base, and
having transverse veins. Roots fleshy, branched, having
much of the smell and taste of ginger. The soil can
hardly be too rich for the successful culture of these
plants. A mixture of equal parts loam, peat, leaf mould, or
thoroughly rotted hotbed manure, freely mixed with sharp
sand or fine charcoal dust, forms an excellent compost.
During the growing season, a top dressing of rotten dung,
and a frequent application of weak manure water, prove
excellent stimulants. They grow rapidly and consume a
great deal of food in the production of so much stem and
so many leaves. Unless the former is vigorous and of
considerable thickness, it will fail to be crowned with spikes
of flower. Alpinias require a high temperature, a rich, light
soil, abundance of water, and not a little space, to grow
them well. Soon after flowering, the plants will assume
the yellow leaf, when water may be gradually withheld;
but no attempt should be made to dry them off too severely,
even after the stems die down. Nor must they be stored
when at rest in a low temperature; in fact, they require
as much heat to preserve them in health when resting as at
any other time. The best time to divide the plants is after
the young shoots have made an inch of growth in spring.</p>

Swedish botanist and friend of Linn√¶us). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Amaryllidace√¶</em>.
Tall handsome hardy or half-hardy tuberous rooted
plants, with leafy stems and terminal umbels of richly-coloured
flowers; perianth regular, six-parted, subcam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>panulate;
inner segments narrower, two of which are
somewhat tubulose at the base; stamens included within,
and inserted with perianth; stigma trifid. Leaves linear,
lanceolate, or ovate, and resupinate, or inverted in position
by the twisting of the petiole. Cultivation: Few plants
need less attention to grow them successfully, either in pots
or planted out. The best position for those kinds which
succeed outside is a deep and dry, sloping, sheltered border,
in a compost of two-parts peat and leaf soil, and one loam
with some sharp sand. Water freely if severe drought
sets in; a surface covering of common moss, or cut fern
in winter, will prove an advantage. They are very effective
in masses. Propagation: They may be increased by
seed or root division. Sow the former when ripe, or in
early spring, thinly in pans, pots, or boxes, and place in a cool
house or frame, so that they will receive some fostering in
their early stages. The seedlings should be pricked out
singly, when large enough to handle, and grown on till well
established under glass. A mixture of peat, leaf mould,
and sandy loam, is the best compost in which to sow the
seeds and grow the young plants. When sufficiently established,
they may be placed in a warm sheltered spot
outside, and about 1ft. apart. The fasciculated masses of
fleshy roots are readily separated into as many pieces as
there are crowns; this operation may be performed during
September or October, or February and March; but it
must be done carefully. Except for the sake of increase,
the less they are disturbed the better. They are excellent
subjects for pot culture (some can only be managed thus,
unless planted out in a house), and may be potted as early
in the autumn as possible, in 8in., 10in., or 12in. pots.
Thorough drainage is essential; arrange the crocks carefully,
and place a layer of thin turfy loam over them. A
compost of equal parts turfy loam, leaf mold, and fibrous
peat, with an abundance of sand, will suit them admirably.
Water sparingly at first, but when root-action is fully
resumed, they must never be allowed to get dry. Support
the stems by staking when they require it, and just
previous to flowering, top-dress with some rotten manure
and leaf soil. Occasional syringings will be necessary
to keep down red spider, especially if the atmosphere is
very dry. As the plants finish flowering, and the leaves
fade, gradually diminish the supply of water until the
stems are quite down, when they may be placed somewhere
out of the way, free from frost, for the winter, but not kept
dry enough to make them shrivel. In repotting, as much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the old soil as is practicable should be removed, without
seriously disturbing the roots, and the plants shifted into
larger or the same sized pots, according to their condition.
Alstr√∂merias were at one time much more largely grown
than they are at present, and the genus was represented
in nearly every garden.</p>

known ornamental-leaved half-hardy plants, with inconspicuous
flowers in axillary heads. Some of the undermentioned
species and varieties belong, technically
speaking, to <em>Telanthera</em>, in which genus the five stamens
are inseparate below, and alternate with as many sterile
filaments. They are so universally known in gardening
under the present generic name, that we have here included
them for convenience' sake. Where Alternantheras
are used in large quantities (and if they are to be used
effectively, a considerable number must be provided), their
economical propagation becomes a matter of importance.
A good colour can only be secured by growing them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
some house or pit in the full light and warmth of the sun;
for, unless so grown, green or badly coloured plants will be
the result. The best and quickest way of producing this
class of plants in large quantities, is to make up a special
hotbed for them about the end of March or beginning of
April. If a pit be used, it should be filled up within
6in. of the glass with leaves and manure, or any other
material that will produce a steady bottom heat of 80deg.
or 85deg., and will last for three weeks or so at that
point; which, at this season, will be an easy matter.
When the heat has become regular and steady, about 4in.
or 5in. of light, rich, sandy soil should be placed all over
the surface, adding, at the same time, a sprinkling of silver
sand on the top, and pressing it moderately firm with a
flat board. The cuttings may now be prepared and dibbled
in, 1in. apart each way. If kept close, moist, and shaded
from bright sunshine, in a few days they will be forming
roots, and so soon as that takes place the shading should
be discontinued, and the ventilation gradually increased
until they are finally hardened off and planted out. If
carefully lifted, and placed in trays or baskets, with a
rhubarb leaf over them, they may be taken any distance,
and planted without flagging; with this advantage&mdash;that
the plants being in good colour, the beds are effective
at once. April is early enough to commence striking them,
and these will be fit to plant out by the middle of June.

small green or red flowers in large bracteate clustered
spikes. Flowers polygamous, furnished with three bracts
at the base of a three or five-lobed glabrous perianth.
Stamens four or five. Of very easy culture; they thrive
best in rich loamy soil, and are largely employed for
sub-tropical and other bedding, for vases and conservatory

be sown in April in a hotbed, and the plants thinned
out in the same situation when about ¬Ωin. high. About the
end of May, they can be transplanted out of doors in
their permanent situations. They are also very handsome
when grown in pots. The young plants should be potted
off early, and freely encouraged, allowing plenty of pot-room

<p><strong>AMARYLLIDE√Ü.</strong> A large and important order of
usually bulbous plants, sometimes with a stem. Flowers
solitary, umbellate, or paniculate; perianth superior, six-lobed,
often with a corona at the top of the tube. Leaves
ensiform or linear. This order contains many very beautiful
genera, including <em>Agave</em>, <em>Amaryllis</em>, <em>Crinum</em>, <em>H√¶manthus</em>,
<em>Hippeastrum</em>, <em>Narcissus</em>, <em>Pancratium</em>, and several
others.</p>

<p><a name="AMARYLLIS" id="AMARYLLIS"></a><strong>AMARYLLIS</strong> (from <em>Amaryllis</em>, the name of a country-woman
mentioned by Theocritus and Virgil). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>.
<em>Amaryllide√¶</em>. Half-hardy or hardy, deciduous, bulbous
plants. Flowers large, sweet-scented, pedicelled; spathe
two-leaved; umbels few-flowered; perianth with a very
short tube, funnel-shaped, six-parted, sub-regular or irregular;
segments many-nerved, broad, undulate, spreading
somewhat at the apices; stamens at the summit of the
tube, unequal, declined; anthers fixed by the middle, incumbent,
curved into a circular arch after bursting; style
declined; stigma thickened, sub-three-lobed; scape tall,
solid, compressed. Capsule obovate; seeds globose, fleshy.
Leaves appearing at a different season from the scapes,
numerous, strap-shaped. The following genera are sometimes
arranged hereunder, but in this work are treated
separately: <em>Brunsvigia</em>, <em>Crinum</em>, <em>Hippeastrum</em>, <em>Nerine</em>,
<em>Sprekelia</em>, <em>Sternbergia</em>, <em>Vallota</em>, <em>Zephyranthes</em>. Warm,
dry, and well-drained positions in front of hothouses,
or at the base of south or south-west
walls, are the most suitable
sites for <em>A. Belladonna</em> and
its varieties. The soil should
be composed of good, fibrous
loam, leaf mould, and sand, in
equal parts. Insert the bulbs
6in. to 8in. deep, and surround
with sand, after which they
may be covered with the compost,
which should be pressed
firmly about them; they should
not be again disturbed for years,
when they will ultimately establish
themselves, and produce
grand masses of blossom. The
best time to plant a fresh stock
is June or July, when they
commence root-action, before
the flower-stems are sent up.
In their growing season, and
in dry weather, an occasional
soaking of clear water, or liquid manure, will be
greatly beneficial. The extremely ornamental plants now
largely grown, and frequently classed as <em>Amaryllis</em> in
nurserymen's catalogues, belong to the genus <em>Hippeastrum</em>.

<p><a name="AMERICAN_BLIGHT" id="AMERICAN_BLIGHT"></a><strong>AMERICAN BLIGHT</strong>, or <strong>WOOLLY APHIS</strong>
(<em>Schizoneura lanuginosa</em>). The white, cottony-looking matter
which is found upon the bark of the Apple and other
trees of a similar nature, belongs to a species of Aphis,
which has short legs: the females are wingless, while
the males are winged; the latter appear in July and
August. The insects belong to a group of Aphides unprovided
with honey tubes on the hinder part of the body,
and in which the third vein of the front wing shows
only one fork The woolly coating also distinguishes them
from true Aphides. The Blight is said to have been imported
from America in 1787, but this is uncertain.</p>

<p>As these insects get into the cracks and under the bark
of trees, they are hard to dislodge. The injury inflicted is
not apparent for some time; but, in process of time, large,
cankerous wounds are produced, which gradually (with the
aid of the insects) destroy the branches, and render the
tree useless. If young trees are attacked, they are rendered
valueless in a very short time. The insects hide
in crevices of the bark of the trees each autumn, and
remain dormant during the winter, ascending to their old
quarters as the weather becomes warm. Trees which are
covered with moss and lichens probably serve as places
for hybernation; hence, it is desirable to remove such
hiding-places, as well as all pieces of dead bark. To their
being left may be frequently attributed the severe attacks
of Blight experienced where they exist on trees. So soon
as the cottony substance makes its appearance, one of the
following remedies should be applied, and, if persisted in
for a few seasons, the trees will be quite cleared.</p>

<p><em>Brushing and Scraping.</em> In winter, the trees should
be thoroughly cleaned; and, so long as there is a chance
of the insects being in the bark, all loose pieces, moss,
&amp;c., should be brushed off, and the parts affected should
be thoroughly saturated with a strong solution of soft soap
or of soft soap and lime-water, applied with a stiff brush,
so as to enter all the crevices.</p>

<p><em>Gas Liquor.</em> This is the ammoniacal liquor from gas
works. It must be diluted with from eight to twelve
times its bulk of water, or it is dangerous to the trees;
in fact, after dilution, it is advisable to test it, previous
to using to any great extent. As the woolly covering
of the insects resists water, it is desirable that the liquor
be applied with a brush, and forced amongst the Blight.</p>

<p><em>Infusion of Tobacco Leaves</em> (¬Ωlb. to 1 gallon) kills the
insects on shoots dipped into it.</p>

<p><em>Paraffin or Petroleum.</em> This is a simple and useful
remedy. Obtain a painter's half-worn sash-tool, free
from paint, and just moisten it in the oil. Then brush
out each infested place as often as the Blight appears,
and in one season the trees will be cleared.</p>

<p><em>Spent Tan.</em> Collect spent tan into a heap a month or
two before it is to be used, and if it has heated well and
rotted, so much the better. In winter, clear away all
leaves, rubbish, grass, &amp;c., and spread the tan at the rate
of about thirty loads to the acre, taking care that it
surrounds the base of each tree infested with Blight.
Practical proof of its utility has been given.</p>

<p><em>Turpentine and other Spirits.</em> The mode of applying
these is the same as for paraffin, but they frequently injure
the bark, and sometimes kill young trees.</p>

<p>To kill insects on the roots, it is well to clear away
the soil as far as possible from them, and to saturate
the place with soapsuds or ammoniacal solutions; soot,
quicklime, or other applications to the soil would also
prove useful.</p>

<p>Other remedies that have been suggested are the drainings
of stables, and grafting-clay plastered over the bark.</p>

Including <em>Proteinophallus</em>. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Aroide√¶ (Arace√¶)</em>.
A very remarkable genus, closely allied to <em>Arum</em>, but distinguished
therefrom by "their spreading, not convolute,
spathes; by their anthers opening by pores, not by longitudinal
slits; by the numerous cells to the ovary; and by the
solitary, erect ovules, those of <em>Arum</em> being horizontal."
A soil consisting of two-thirds good rich loam, with the
additional third of sweet manure, thoroughly rotted, suits
them well. Other essentials are plenty of pot room, a
genial atmosphere, and a temperature ranging from 55deg.
to 65deg., or even 70deg. They require to be kept dry,
and warm in winter, as nothing is more fatal to them than
cold or damp. Beneath a shelf or stage in the stove is an
excellent spot for them, or they may be stored in sand,
and kept free from frost. They are difficult to increase;
the corms of most of them are of great size, and rarely
make offsets. Efforts should consequently be made to
induce the plants to seed whenever practicable. All the
species are strikingly effective in sub-tropical bedding.

<em>Rosace√¶</em>. T<span class="smcapa">RIBE</span> <em>Drupace√¶</em>. Well known, ornamental,
deciduous spring flowering shrubs. Drupe clothed with
velvety pubescence, with a fibrous dry rind, separating
irregularly, having the stone of the fruit pitted or smooth.
The larger-growing species are very excellent for shrubberies,
or as specimen trees; being in blossom before
most other trees, they make a fine appearance in early
spring. The dwarfer kinds are also well fitted for small
shrubberies or the fronts of large ones. For greenhouse
culture they should be obtained in a small pyramidal
shape; they are not, however, suited to a small house,
as the plants, to bloom well and be effective, ought to
be at least 2ft. or 3ft. high, and proportionately wide.
Plenty of root room is essential. After potting, water
thoroughly, and place the trees in an orchard house for a
few weeks, when they may be removed to their permanent
station. A temperature of about 50deg. or 55deg. is
sufficient to hasten the flowering; a higher temperature is
apt to frustrate the object in view. After flowering,
gradually harden off the plants until about the end of
May, when they may be plunged out of doors for the
season. Repotting should be done as soon as the leaves
fall. Increased by budding upon seedling plum-stocks
in summer. The Almond is grown on the Continent for its
fruit. <em>See also</em> <strong>Prunus</strong>.</p>

Leaves rigid; edges spiny. The variegated form is a
useful plant for decorative purposes, and may be employed
without the usual harmful consequences attending stove
plants generally, but it must not be subjected to cold
draughts. The soil should consist of two parts fibrous
loam, one of peat, one of dung and leaf mould, and another
of sand. Those propagated from suckers, which should
be laid by a day or two and then inserted in a strong heat,
have, as a rule, longer and lighter-coloured leaves. Offsets
are often produced at the base of the fruit, and make stout
plants, with high-coloured foliage. When the plants are
potted in spring, plunge them in bottom heat, to hasten
their growth; but this is not absolutely necessary. Should
it be desired to fruit the variegated form, the plants may
be submitted to the same process of culture as detailed

<p><strong>ANEMIDICTYON.</strong> <em>See</em> <a href="#ANEMIA"><strong>Anemia</strong>.</a></p>

<p><a name="ANEMONE" id="ANEMONE"></a><strong>ANEMONE</strong> (from <em>anemos</em>, wind; the greater part of
the species grow in elevated places, much exposed to the
wind). Wind Flower. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Ranunculace√¶</em>. An extensive
genus of very ornamental hardy perennials. The generic
characters of Anemone proper are: Involucre of three cut
leaflets, distant from the flower; calyx of five to twenty
petal-like sepals; petals absent. Of sub-genus Hepatica:
Involucre of three entire leaflets, just under the flowers;
calyx of six to nine petal-like sepals; petals absent. For
botanical purposes, they are both now included under the
one generic name of Anemone; but in gardens the Hepaticas
are frequently regarded as a distinct genus. They
delight in a rich sandy loam, but most will thrive in
ordinary garden soil. Some are suitable for borders,
while others thrive best on the rockery, most of them
preferring a damp and partially shady position. For the
numerous varieties of <em>A. coronaria</em>, both double and single
flowered, the soil can hardly be too rich, and the position,
though open, should be a sheltered one, and well drained.
The tubers may be planted early in October, about 6in.
apart, and 3in. deep, various colours being intermixed, when
a splendid effect is produced in the following spring. After
flowering, the tubers should be taken up&mdash;say in June&mdash;and
spread out thinly, in a shady, airy situation, until they
are dry, when they should be thoroughly cleaned, and, if
necessary, divided, and finally stored away in a cool place,
in pots or boxes of dry sand until the planting season.
Anemones make admirable pot plants if placed in a compost
of two parts turfy loam, and one of leaf mould or rotten
hotbed or cow manure, with about a sixth part of sharp
gritty sand; but, if so grown, they should be protected
through severe weather, and brought into warmth as required.
The herbaceous species are propagated by root
divisions or root cuttings, or by seeds, in autumn or early
spring; the seeds are better sown as soon as ripe in pans
in a cold frame. Some, such as <em>A. japonica</em>, are freely
increased by division; while others, such as <em>A. narcissiflora</em>,
are very slow; and the tuberous rooted ones, by root division
and seeds. The best and most rapid means of propagating
the invaluable varieties of <em>A. coronaria</em>, and also of
obtaining new ones, is by seed. A careful selection of flowers,
and skilful hybridising, will produce results commensurate
with the trouble incurred. So soon as the seed ripen, they
should be gathered and sown at once in a warm sheltered
situation outside, or in pans under glass, covering lightly
with sandy soil, and keeping moist. They are somewhat
difficult to sow on account of a mass of cotton-like down
which adheres closely to them; they should be thoroughly
separated therefrom by rubbing them in dry sand. Of
course, if the seed are sown at different times, plants will
be produced which will flower at different periods, and a
succession of bloom may be had from April to November&mdash;indeed,
nearly all the year.</p>

These are among the most beautiful of epiphytal orchids.
One characteristic, both remarkable and peculiar, is the
long, hollow, tail-like spur depending from the base of the
lip. The flowers are produced on spikes from the axils of
the leaves. The leaves are evergreen, and arranged in two
rows, the one opposite to the other, and, in many kinds,
being curved, give the plant a very graceful appearance.
The fact of these plants producing their blooms during
the winter&mdash;a period when flowers are generally scarce&mdash;considerably
enhances their value. They usually continue
six or eight weeks in perfection, or even more. The following
table of night temperatures should be almost universally
adhered to for all the species enumerated, except
<em>A. falcatum</em>, which thrives best in a cool house. From
November to February, 58deg. to 63deg.; March to May,
September and October, 65deg.; June to August, 70deg.
The day temperature should be 7deg. or 8deg. higher than
that of the night. A compost of crocks, charcoal, and
sphagnum is best. A layer of a few large crocks at the
bottom of the pot or pan will be required; over these
spread another layer of charcoal and smaller crocks, just
enough to allow the roots to support the plant; so
that the first pair of leaves will be, in large plants,
about 4in. above the rim of the pot, or proportionately
less in the case of small plants. When the plant is
carefully adjusted in its proper position, and held there
with one hand, the other hand should work in among the
roots more crocks and charcoal, ceasing so to do when
within 2in. of the rim; the remaining space must be
occupied with fresh sphagnum, pressed firm (this is most
essential) in a cone shape, which may be built up to within
¬Ωin. of the lower pair of leaves. Prior to potting, which
ought to be done between February and April, water should
be withheld for a short time; but give a good soaking
immediately after the operation. In the process of repotting,
clear the roots of the old moss, all rotten stems,
and particles of decayed roots. If plants are potted as
we have recommended, a thorough soaking once a week
only, or if grown on blocks of wood, or in suspended
baskets or pans, about twice weekly will be found sufficient.
Excessive fumigation, drought, whether atmospherical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
or at the roots, will cause the leaves to drop, and prevent
any growth being made, in which case the plant ought to
be lowered. If the stems have emitted but few roots, a
ring of moss fastened round the stems, and kept constantly
wet, will induce the plant to throw out additional roots,
when the lowering may be proceeded with. To keep the
plants free from insect pests, frequently sponge the foliage.
Thrips generally prove very troublesome, and a moderate
fumigation is needful, dislodging the insects that may be
secreted low down in the centre of the plant, shortly before
the operation, by dropping a little weak tobacco water or
sulphur among them.</p>

<p><a name="ANNUALS" id="ANNUALS"></a><strong>ANNUALS.</strong> All plants which spring from the seed,
flower, and die within the course of a year. A number of
things, however, which are not strictly of annual duration,
but which are sown every year in preference to housing
the roots before they are killed by late autumn or winter
frosts, are generally classed, for the sake of convenience,
under the head of Annuals. Hardy Annuals are those
which require no artificial aid to enable them to develop,
but grow and flower freely in the open air. These are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
best sown in the spots where they are intended to remain
during March and April, and care must subsequently be
taken to keep the ground clear of weeds, and also to thin
out the seedlings, allowing each sufficient room to develop
and exhibit its true character. If allowed to remain too
crowded, the plants, as a matter of course, suffer, and the
size and number of the flowers and the general effect are
considerably decreased. Successional sowings of a good
many of the showy species will be found to prolong their
flowering season. In well-kept establishments, where
Annuals are duly appreciated, several sowings are made
in pots at intervals of a few weeks. As the previously-sown
clumps begin to get shabby, they are removed, and
replaced by others which have still to flower. By this
means a continual sheet of blossom can be maintained for
a long time. It is much better to trust to plants grown
in pots in order to carry out the plan just sketched, as
these receive no check when placed in their new quarters;
whilst transplanted clumps frequently fail, and many
species do not transplant at all readily from an open border.
In order to secure, in early spring, a fine show of such
plants as several of the <em>Silenes</em>, <em>Myosotis</em>, <em>Saponaria</em>, and
a number of others, it is best to sow the seeds in an open,
sheltered border, about the end of July or beginning of
August, taking care to keep a small reserve stock in a cold
frame, in case very severe weather kills the unprotected
plants. Half-hardy Annuals are those for which our climate
is not sufficiently warm, or, rather, our summer is not, as a
rule, either hot enough or long enough, to allow them to
grow, flower well, and ripen seeds, if sown in the open air.
Many of these are amongst the showiest of garden plants,
so it is worth while to give them the shelter of a warm
frame during their earlier stages, and gradually harden
them off, planting out at the end of May or beginning of
June, when danger resulting from severe weather is passed.
After germination, the seedlings should have plenty of light
and air, or a weak, spindly growth, and, as a consequence,
poor flowers, will result. The most satisfactory method
of watering very tiny seeds is to place a piece of fine
muslin over the seed-pot, through which the water will be
easily conveyed to the seeds, and thus prevent disturbance.
Tender Annuals require the same treatment as the half-hardy
ones, except that they need throughout their existence
the protection of a glass structure. All, or nearly
all, garden Annuals delight in full sunlight and plenty of
air. In the open, these requirements, as a rule, obtain,
but sometimes mistakes are made under glass by keeping
the plants too close and over much shaded, as well as too
great a distance from the glass.</p>

<p><a name="ANOECTOCHILUS" id="ANOECTOCHILUS"></a><strong>AN≈íCTOCHILUS</strong> (from <em>anoiktos</em>, open, and <em>cheilos</em>,

terrestrial orchids, the radical leaves of which are the
chief attraction, being amongst the most beautiful and
delicate objects in the vegetable kingdom. The flowers,
which should be pinched off so soon as they appear, are, as
a rule, small and unattractive. Few of the species exceed
6in. in height, with leaves from 2in. to 6in. long, including
the fleshy petioles. They require a good deal of attention.
To one part of silver sand, thoroughly washed twice or
three times, add two of sphagnum, which should also
be well washed and picked over, when it should be
chopped into minute particles, in order that it may
freely amalgamate with the sand; mix a little loam and
peat with the whole. In the pots, when well drained by
first placing a large piece of potsherd over the bottom
and nearly half filling up with pieces broken small and
of uniform size, place a thin layer of crude sphagnum,
afterwards filling firmly with the mixture above mentioned,
and bringing it up more or less in the form of a cone above
the rim of the pot, into which the plants should be firmly
fixed. Plants which have been propagated by division
should be carefully transferred to 32-sized pots. About
five separate pieces might be placed evenly over the surface.
Make holes with a neat dibble, and into these drop the
roots their entire length, pressing the soil firmly with the
dibble. Fix them so that they may grow inwardly, and not
out over the rim of the pots, pegging each creeping root
needing such attention firmly down upon the surface of the
soil afterwards; after a good soaking, they may be replaced
in any warm, shady situation. For propagating, a strong
plant is necessary; it may be cut into pieces just below
the first joint, each piece having a root. The bottom piece
should have two eyes&mdash;one to root from, and the other to
push into a shoot. The "bottom," or plant which has been
cut, should be replaced in its pot, and then put under a
bell glass. It will soon throw up a young shoot; this
ought to be left on until well rooted, when it may be
separated and treated similarly to the portion first removed,
still leaving the old part in the pot. These plants
must be grown in glass cases, or under bell glasses, but
they should always have a little air, for, as Mr. Williams
says, when too much confined, they grow up spindly, and
damp off in the stem; the latter, being fleshy, requires more
substance and sturdiness. Air should be admitted through
a space of about 1in. or 2in. The following ranges of
temperature are advised: Winter, night, 55deg. to
60deg.; day, 65deg. to 70deg. during March, April, and
May; night, 60deg. to 70deg.; and, afterwards, a few
degrees higher, with a maximum day temperature of
80deg. Bottom heat should not be given, as it induces a
weak, fast growth. Great care will be needed to prevent
ravages of insects. The most suitable month for repotting
is March, just before growth commences, when the plants
will need plenty of water up to October, excepting when
it is desirous to utilise them as drawing-room ornaments,
in which case they should be kept rather dry for a short
time previous. <em>See also</em> <strong>Dossinia</strong>, <strong>Goodyera</strong>, <strong>H√¶meria</strong>,

<p><a name="ANOMATHECA" id="ANOMATHECA"></a><strong>ANOMATHECA</strong> (from <em>anomos</em>, singular, and <em>theca</em>, a
capsule, or seed-pod). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Iride√¶</em>. Very pretty little
bulbous perennials. Perianth hypocrateriform; tube
triquetrous, constricted at the throat. The species are
hardy when planted in warm sunny situations in the
open border. Their dwarf stature, brilliance, profusion
of flowers, and habit of blossoming continuously over a
long period, render them very popular subjects amongst
growers of hardy perennials. Although generally credited
with being hardy, when cultivated out of doors they should
be lifted and stored in frost-proof quarters before winter
commences, until the following March. They are excellent
as window garden plants, and also for pot culture. If
grown in pots, they should be shaken out, and repotted in
February or March. They multiply very rapidly, and may
be divided in patches, not by single bulbs, once yearly.
Light sandy loam, mixed with a little leaf mould, is the
best compost. Anomathecas are sometimes increased by
seed, which may be sown so soon as ripe, very thinly, in
seed pans. Thin out the seedlings if growing very close
together; the next season they may be put out four or
five in a pot. When they become crowded, shift into a
much larger pot, but do not disturb the ball. The young
seedlings will probably produce flowers the second season.</p>

thrive best in rich light soil, and are excellent subjects
for pot culture; for which purpose use a compost of
fibrous loam, leaf mould, or well-decayed manure, and
coarse sand. The pots should be about 12in. across, well
drained, and the plants potted just previous to, or so
soon as, growth commences. During activity, plenty of
water is needed, until the plants have finished flowering,

solitary; corolla campanulate. Cuttings strike freely in
sand under a bell glass, with a mild bottom heat. So soon as
they have well rooted, pot off into very small pots in two-thirds
good loam and one of peat. After having made

of bulbous plants from the Cape of Good Hope, having
narrow, erect, Iris-like leaves, and flower-spikes that over-top
the foliage, bearing numerous bright-coloured flowers.
Perianth tubular, six-cleft, unequal, the upper segments
longest; stamens three. The species may be grown in a
greenhouse, or planted out in a frame. They also thrive
excellently out of doors, and should be planted 8in. or
9in. deep for fear of frost, or have a winter protection of
several inches of cocoa-nut fibre refuse or litter. The safer
plan is to raise the roots, winter them in some dry part of
the greenhouse; but, previous to storing, divide the clumps,
clean them, and re-plant or pot in February, or early in
March. A mixture of equal parts peat, sandy loam, and leaf
soil is most suitable for their culture. Just previous to
flowering, if in pots, frequent doses of weak manure water
will be found beneficial. They may be propagated by offsets,
which are produced in abundance, at almost any time.
Seeds are sometimes procured, which should be sown so
soon as ripe, in light soil, in a cool house, where they will
germinate the following spring, and will be fit to plant
out in the summer of the same year. With the exception
of <em>A. Cunonia</em>, they all much resemble each other. Only
four or five species of this genus are worth cultivating.</p>

densely disposed on a cylindrical spadix, at the base of which
is a large bract-like spathe, that ultimately bends backwards.
Leaves of various shapes. This very large genus of
handsome stove and greenhouse plants is remarkable both
for the peculiar inflorescence and often noble leaves, and is
distinguished in structure from all the European members
of the order in the flowers being hermaphrodite. Fibry
peat, loam, sphagnum, broken crocks, or charcoal, and
silver sand, form the most suitable compost. In preparing
the peat, it should be broken up into small lumps, and then
have most of the earthy matter knocked out of it by giving
it a few raps with a stick, or by shaking it about in a sieve.
To this, after so treated, add about one-fourth its bulk of
sphagnum, and about half its bulk of fibrous loam, and
just a sprinkling of fresh broken crocks, or small pieces of
charcoal and sharp silver sand. In placing them in
the pots&mdash;which must be well drained&mdash;carefully spread
out the roots and work the mixture among them, keeping
the plant well up, so that when finished it stands
clear above the rim of the pot at least 2in. or 3in., and
forms a kind of mound or hillock. They must then be
kept freely syringed or watered, and placed in a moist
atmosphere, where they can enjoy a temperature ranging
between 60deg. and 70deg., or a few degrees lower for
the less tender species. Raising plants from seed requires
patience. About a year elapses from the time the flowers
are fertilised&mdash;which should be done artificially&mdash;before the
seed ripens, and often another to get up plants. Sow as
soon as ripe in shallow, well-drained pans or pots, filled
with the potting mixture, and cover slightly, and place in a
close, moist propagating case, where a temperature of from
75deg. to 85deg. is maintained, or they may be covered
with bell glasses. The principal thing is to keep the
air about them constantly humid, and the material in
which they are sown in a uniformly moist condition;
if this is done, the young seedlings will make their appearance
in due course. When these are of sufficient
size to handle, they should be pricked off in the same
sort of compost, and be kept close and moist till they
get a start, after which gradually inure them to more air.
January is the best month of the year wherein to propagate
these plants by divisions. This is done by carefully turning
them out of their pots and shaking out what soil
they have amongst their roots, which must be tenderly
dealt with, so as not to bruise or injure them.
This done, they may then be pulled apart, and as many
plants made as there are separate crowns, or the mass may
be simply halved or quartered, according to the stock required.
Treat now as recommended above for potting.
They are all moisture-loving plants, and must have a
copious supply of water at all times, although, of course,
much less during the winter than spring and summer
months. There is no season of the year when they can
be handled for any purpose with less risk or check than
January. A moderate moist stove heat is advisable for
them generally. The species enumerated are selected from
nearly 150, and will be found to be a very representative
collection. <em>See also</em> <strong>Spathiphyllum</strong>.</p>

<p><a name="ANTIRRHINUM" id="ANTIRRHINUM"></a><strong>ANTIRRHINUM</strong> (from <em>anti</em>, like, and <em>rhin</em>, a nose or
snout; alluding to the shape of the corolla). Snapdragon.
O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Scrophulariace√¶</em>. Hardy herbaceous plants. Flowers
in terminal racemes, or solitary and axillary; corolla personate;
tube ample, saccate at the base; lobes of the
upper lip erect; lower lip spreading, having the middle
lobes smaller than the lateral ones, with an ample bearded
palate, which closes the throat. Seed pod or capsule two-celled,
upper cell bursting by one pore, lower by two many-toothed
pores. See Fig. 113. Leaves entire, rarely lobed.
The genus contains several very handsome species, suitable
for borders and the rockery, while innumerable varieties
have originated from <em>A. majus</em>, which are very popular,
and extremely useful for bedding purposes; these may be
increased by cuttings or seeds; if it is desired to increase
certain colours or varieties, the former is the only sure
method to adopt. They should be taken in September,
when they will readily root in a cold frame, or under a
hand glass, or they may be rapidly propagated in gentle
heat in spring. Seeds should be sown in July or August,
when they will produce good plants by the following season;
or if sown in March in warmth, the plants will bloom late
in the same year. The "Tom Thumb" strain is especially
desirable for bedding, being very dwarf and free. All the
other species may be increased by cuttings and seeds treated
in the same way. Light soil, well enriched with manure, is
most suitable for all of them, especially for the varieties of
<em>A. majus</em>.</p>

<p><a name="ANTS" id="ANTS"></a><strong>ANTS</strong> (<em>Formicid√¶</em>). Well-known pests, easily distinguished
from all other insects. There are a great number
of species, differing more or less in habits; but, as a
rule, they dwell underground in communities, and construct
extensive ant-cities, which are occupied by three
classes&mdash;the neuters or workers (by far the most
numerous), the males, and the females. There are often,
in addition to these, larger and stronger neuters, known
as the "soldiers," or defenders of the community. Ants
have a long, slender body, supported on long and slender
legs. The head bears a pair of elbowed horns or antenn√¶,
constantly waving about and touching everything
the insect comes across. They have powerful mandibles
for cutting, sawing, and biting, and it is with these instruments
that Ants do mischief in gardens. The winged
males and females become mature in summer, and on a
warm day they ascend in a body into the air; after a
short time, they fall to the ground, the females at once
free themselves from the henceforth useless wings, and
begin to form new colonies. Vast numbers of eggs are
laid, from which issue larv√¶, and these soon become
pup√¶, and then perfect Ants. Some kinds are injurious
from their habit (in some species) of collecting aphides
together, and farming them for the sake of the honey
secreted by the aphides, and that passes out from their
honey-tubes (thus helping to perpetuate the stock of
these most injurious insects); and also from the mechanical
damage they do in pots, and other receptacles for
plants. They likewise cause unsightly hills on lawns
and paths, and the large black species that live in decayed
wood often injure the framing of greenhouses, &amp;c., when
the woodwork has become somewhat decayed. Where
fruit, such as peaches or wall pears, are grown, Ants will
at times inflict damage, and, therefore, they should be
kept away; but this is a comparatively easy matter, as
the placing of an obnoxious substance along the base of
the walls and around the stems of the trees will deter
them. For the extirpation of Ants from indoors, the
Arsenical solution described below is most efficacious,
but it is extremely dangerous.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Lime.</em> Air-slaked lime plentifully dusted, in warm, dry,
weather, over and around the hills and other places infested,
will cause the Ants to vacate them in a short time. A
thick chalk line drawn round a smooth tree, or across an
upright board or post, will render it impassable.</p>

<p><em>Arsenic.</em> This must be used with the utmost caution, as
it is a poison most fatal to animal life. Recipe: 1oz. of
ordinary arsenic is placed in an old iron pot with a quart of
water, and then boiled until reduced to a pint or a little
more of liquid, to which is added ¬Ωlb. of coarse sugar.
This mixture can either be dropped about the runs and
around the nests, or placed in saucers in the Ants' haunts.</p>

<p><em>Ferrocyanide of Potassium.</em> This is also very dangerous:
Ferrocyanide of potassium, 1dr.; raspings of quassia, 1dr.;
and enough sugar to form a syrup. Use in the same way as
the preceding.</p>

<p><em>Calomel and Sugar.</em> Mix together one part of calomel
and ten parts of finely-powdered loaf sugar, and lay it
in little heaps about their nests and runs; the Ants will
eat it and die. Spring is the best season for this method.</p>

<p><em>Guano</em>, when fresh, if sprinkled on and around their
quarters, is said to be efficacious in driving them away.</p>

<p><em>Camphor.</em> If a piece of camphor, about the size of a
filbert, be placed in two quarts of hot water, and this,
when cool enough, applied to pot or other plants infested
with Ants, the insects will be driven off without injury
to the plants.</p>

<p><em>Bones.</em> Lay a quantity of partially-picked boiled bones
in the haunts, and they will be quickly covered with
insects. As soon as this occurs, throw the bones into hot
water. Before laying them down again, let all superfluous
moisture drain off. This is a cheap remedy, and,
if persisted in, is very effectual.</p>

<p><em>Carbolic Acid.</em> This, if of good strength, diluted with
about ten or twelve times its bulk of water, and well
sprinkled over paths or other places where there is no
vegetation, will keep the Ants away. It has, however,
an objectionable smell.</p>

<p><em>Paraffin Oil.</em> Paraffin, mixed with six times its bulk of
water, and sprinkled over the nests every few days, will
kill and drive away Ants; but the smell is disagreeable.</p>

<p><em>Quassia.</em> 4oz. of quassia chips, boiled in a gallon of
water for about ten minutes, and 4oz. of soap added to
the liquor as it cools, if used like the preceding, is fairly
effectual; but this, like the other remedies, must be
persisted in for some time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Fly pans or saucers, nearly filled with thin honey or
sweet oil, attract Ants, and they are drowned in them.
Ants are very hard to clear effectually out of a place,
and therefore it is very desirable, in all attempts to be
rid of them, to persist in the above remedies. When not
living close to the roots or stems of plants, the best and
surest remedy of all is to flood them out or scald them
in with boiling water. The specifics are endless, but the
best are mentioned above.</p>

The best way to induce them to flower in this country is
by cutting a ring round the bark of a large branch; by this
means the growth is stopped. Well ripened cuttings should
be planted in sand in heat, under a bell glass, which should
be tilted occasionally, so as to give a little air to the cuttings,

male; the anthers being one-celled). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Acanthace√¶</em>.
Very handsome stove evergreen shrubs, mostly of an erect
habit of growth, and having handsome shining leaves,
which in some instances are variegated. Flowers produced
in terminal four-sided spikes&mdash;the preponderating
colours being brilliant shades of orange or scarlet&mdash;conspicuously
situated above the foliage; they are exceedingly
attractive; corolla ringent, two-lipped, upper
lip three-lobed; central lobe large. They bloom generally
during the autumn months, and if the plants are
removed to a warm dry atmosphere so soon as the flowers
begin to open, they will continue much longer in perfection
than if left in the moisture-laden atmosphere of the stove.
From the time the flower spikes are at first seen till they
bloom, the plants will derive much benefit from frequent
applications of clear manure water. When the plants have
finished flowering, they should be allowed to rest, by reducing
the supply of water, but never allow them to shrivel.
During this time they may be kept in a house or pit, where
the atmosphere is rather dry, with a night temperature of
50deg. to 55deg. Here they may remain till March, when
they should be pruned. This operation is commenced by
thinning out the weakest shoots altogether, and cutting the
others back to one or two of the strongest joints or buds
above the old wood in order to keep the plants dwarf and
bushy. When pruned, the plants should be placed in the
stove, giving moderate supplies of water at the roots, and
occasionally sprinkling the stems overhead till growth commences.
When the young shoots have attained an inch or so
in length, the plants should be turned out of the pots, removing
the crocks and as much of the old soil as can be got away
easily, at the same time shortening-in any of the straggling
roots. They should then be placed into smaller-sized pots,
keeping them rather close, and watering them carefully for
a time till growth has commenced. When fairly started,
they may be transferred into larger-sized pots, in which
they are to flower. During the summer, these plants
require a moist atmosphere, with a temperature of 65deg.
by night, allowing it to rise 15deg. or 20deg. by day, and
whilst active growth is taking place they should be frequently
supplied with moisture at the roots, keeping them
well exposed on all sides to the light. After growth has
commenced, it is not advisable to stop the shoots, for
the stouter and stronger they grow up the finer will be
the flower spikes when they appear. The compost should
consist of equal parts fibry loam, leaf soil, and peat, with a
good proportion of sand added. In preparing it, it should be
rather lumpy, and, before using, should be warmed to about
the temperature of the house in which the plants are
grown. Clean pots and perfect drainage are most essential.
Cuttings are best prepared from half ripened wood,
or taken off when young with a heel. The base of each
cutting should invariably be cut clean across. These
may be inserted an inch apart, in pots of sandy soil, and
plunged in a brisk bottom heat. To obtain young shoots
for cuttings, if the old plants break freely after pruning,
and very large specimens are not required, when the shoots
are 2in. long they should be thinned out, leaving the
requisite number of the strongest to form the plant. If
the surplus pieces are removed with a slight heel of the
older wood, they make good cuttings, and should be treated
the same as the others. These cuttings strike root quickest,
and when rooted, if potted into 5in. or 6in. pots, and allowed
to grow up without stopping or pinching out the tops, they
will flower the first season. Although Aphelandras can be
grown into large sized specimens, it will be found to be
more generally satisfactory to have specimens of neat and
moderate dimensions. The mealy bug and scale insects
are very troublesome, and must be kept down, otherwise
they will prove most prejudicial to the plants.</p>

<p><a name="APHIDES" id="APHIDES"></a><strong>APHIDES</strong>, or <strong>PLANT LICE</strong>. These belong to
the order <em>Homoptera</em>, meaning "same winged," and the
name has reference to the fact that the fore wings
are uniform in their structure from base to apex, not
divided into a leathery base and a membranous tip.
Aphides are all minute in size, soft bodied, and generally
long legged; the mouth is furnished with a curiously-constructed
beak, or rostrum, for sucking the juice of
plants; the antenn√¶, or feelers, are long and slender;
the legs have usually two joints in the tarsi, one of
which is generally very ill-developed; and near the tip
of the abdomen, on the back of a ring, in many kinds,
stand two prominent tubes, called honey-tubes, from
which a sweet secretion, much sought after by ants,
is emitted. They are very destructive, and nearly every
plant has its own peculiar Aphis; but among the worst
are the cherry fly and bean fly. All these insects
are very destructive to the young shoots and foliage of
plants, on which they cluster in large numbers, sometimes
completely hiding the stems, increasing with marvellous
rapidity. They produce eggs in autumn, which lie dormant
through the winter, and upon the approach of
warm weather in spring, hatch and produce individuals
which, during the summer, are viviparous, budding off
young insects at a surprising rate, which quickly in turn
become possessed of the same marvellous power; hence
the enormous number which are produced in so surprisingly
short a time. It has been computed that in a few
weeks many millions of young might be produced directly
or descended from a single female. <em>See also</em> <a href="#BLACK_FLY"><strong>Black Fly</strong></a>
and <a href="#BEAN_FLY"><strong>Bean Fly</strong>.</a></p>

<p>The following remedies may be successfully employed:</p>

<p><em>Tobacco.</em> This is applied, as a rule, in three forms, each
of which is useful for particular purposes. Tobacco powder
is useful as a dry application to plants where, from any
cause, the other modes of employing it are not desirable.
It causes no smell, and is useful in conservatories, &amp;c., for
that reason. The mode of applying it is to dredge or dust
it over the foliage of the plants affected, and to syringe off
in from three to thirty hours, according to the nature of
the plants. Fumigation with tobacco, if done in a proper
way, is very effective, but it leaves an unpleasant smell.
The foliage of the plants should be quite dry, and a still
day must be chosen for the work; the house should be
filled with smoke, but no flame must arise in the burning.
The plants should be well syringed the next morning, and
full ventilation allowed; if the fumigation is repeated
twice or thrice, it will prove very effectual. Tobacco water
is made by soaking a pound of coarse shag in 6gals. of hot
water, to which ¬Ωlb. of size or soft soap has been added.
The plants should be dipped into or syringed with this
mixture, and well syringed with clean tepid water about
twelve hours after. It should not be employed for plants
having woolly or hairy foliage. Tobacco paper and cloth
are used for fumigating in the same manner as tobacco;
but as they vary in strength, more care is necessary, as
they sometimes cause the leaves to become spotted. Judiciously
employed, they are cheaper than Tobacco.</p>

<p><em>Quassia.</em> Boil 1lb. quassia chips in 4gals. of soft water,
for about ten minutes, and after straining off the chips, add
1lb. of soft soap. Apply in the same way as Tobacco water,
and syringe the plants with clean water after ten minutes
or a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p><em>Soft Soap.</em> This, in proportion of 8lb. to 12gals. of rain
water, and 1gal. of tobacco water added after it is cold,
is a cheap and good remedy out of doors, and requires the
same mode of application as tobacco water.</p>

<p><em>Soap Suds.</em> Where bleaching powder, or much soda,
is not mixed with these, they make a good insect killer
for hard-foliaged plants, but should be washed off with
clean water in twelve hours. No mixture containing
chloride of lime should be used.</p>

<p><em>Various.</em> Fir-tree Oil, Gishurst's Compound, and Fowler's
Insecticide, are all serviceable, if used as directed on the
labels. Hardeman's Beetle Powder, applied with the little
French powder-bellows which is sold with it, is very efficacious.
For outdoor work, nothing surpasses clean cold
water, applied often and forcibly with a syringe.</p>

<p>The best mode of clearing Aphis off Beaus, Currants,
&amp;c., is to remove the tops of the infested shoots, and
to wash the plants with soapy water, or a solution of
Gishurst's Compound. In some cases, a good dusting with
soot and wood ashes, while the plants are wet, will keep
them in check. The "Golden Eyes" or "Lacewing" fly,
and also ladybirds, are to be encouraged, as the larv√¶
of each of these wage incessant war against Aphides,
especially the green varieties, and thin them out considerably.</p>

There are several species, but <em>A. distachyon</em> is superior to

and rotten cow manure, using, of course, small pots, if the
vessel in which it is to be grown is restricted. When
introducing it to large tanks or lakes, commence with
strong, previously well-established plants, in large pots,
breaking the latter when the plants are immersed.
Place them in positions where the water is about 1ft. 6in.
to 2ft. deep; they will then rapidly increase by offsets and
seeds, and, when established, will flower nearly all the
year round. The other kinds will thrive with the same
treatment; but they are neither so hardy nor so vigorous,

<p><a name="APPLE" id="APPLE"></a><strong>APPLE</strong> (<em>Pyrus Malus</em>). The Apple is one of the most
useful, and probably most largely cultivated, of our hardy
fruits. It is known as the Crab in its wild state, and is
indigenous to Britain and to all the temperate and warmer
parts of Europe. It is supposed that the progenitors of the
varieties now grown were introduced to this country
at various times from the Continent, and not obtained here
as direct improvements on the native Crab. Those now
cultivated are extremely numerous, and include good
varieties that can be made to prolong the season all the
year round. Apart from its great value as a fruit, the
apple is a strikingly handsome tree when in flower (see
Fig. 121). A fruiting branch is shown at Fig. 122.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Propagation.</em> Seeds are sown extensively, chiefly for
raising stocks to graft approved sorts on; also with a view
to raising new varieties. The seeds do not retain their
germinative properties very long, consequently they must
be sown soon after being taken from the fruit. As grown
in this country, they are generally sown in the autumn,
transplanted the following year, and so on until they are
of sufficient size for Grafting purposes. The standard of
excellence being at present so high, improved forms raised
from seed are comparatively scarce.</p>

<p><em>Grafting.</em> This method of propagation is the one
generally adopted for most purposes, the stocks being previously
prepared for size or height of tree required. Cordon
and other dwarf-trained trees should be worked near but
not below the ground, while standards are best worked on
stocks of the desired height. The practice of working
standard trees low, and growing the scion to form the stem
of the future tree, is not recommended, as many of the
tenderer sorts will not grow straight or strong enough for
the purpose. Whip-grafting is the most preferable mode
adopted. The scions should be selected from healthy trees
not later than January, and laid in singly in the ground
until the stocks have slightly advanced in growth, which is
generally about the middle of April. Several other methods
of Grafting may be adopted with success, but the one above
recommended is considered the best.</p>

<p><em>Budding.</em> Apples may be successfully propagated by
Budding, and this method is practised much more now than
formerly. It has many advantages, as it requires to be
performed at a season when there is not so much work in
hand. It should be done in damp, dull weather, if possible,
as the weather if dry soon destroys the buds. July and
August is the proper time for the purpose. The stocks
and woods from which the buds are taken should be as
much as possible in the same condition.</p>

<p><em>Propagation by Cuttings, Layers, &amp;c.</em> This system may
be made use of in the case of new varieties or where it is
desired to increase any one variety with a limited number
of scions, but the results are uncertain&mdash;at least in the
case of cuttings; consequently, it is much better to resort
to the safer method of Grafting.</p>

<p><em>Pruning.</em> <em>See</em> <strong>Pruning</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Training.</em> <em>See</em> <strong>Training</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Planting.</em> The best time to plant is as soon as most of
the leaves have fallen, which is generally about the end of
October. The roots being then in an active state, and the
ground still retaining a certain amount of heat, they will
form new roots before winter, which is a material advantage.
Where it is impossible to plant at this time, it may
be done in suitable weather any time during the winter,
but it is best not deferred till spring. It is important in
planting that the soil should be moderately dry and free
from frost; this condition cannot always be obtained during
winter. The effects of soil and situation have a very important
bearing on the Apple, specimens of the same sort
from different places being often hardly recognisable.
Although not over fastidious in the matter of soil as far as
growing is concerned, the best results are obtained where
it is of a rich loamy character and well drained. Dry,
sandy soils invariably produce canker, while the trees are
often overgrown with lichens in undrained land. The
addition of heavier loam, or sometimes trenching and
mixing the sub-soil with that at the top, will convert light
soils into those suitable for Apple culture; while, on the
other hand, heavy soils may be improved by drainage, the
addition of lime, vegetable refuse, burnt earth, and other
matters. Rank manure should on no account be used anywhere
near the roots, but a little well-decayed manure,
mixed with the soil or used as a mulching, is beneficial.
The site best suited is an open, though not exposed one,
with a south, south-east, or south-west aspect. Shelter
from north-east winds in spring, which destroys the bloom,
and from west and south-west winds in autumn, which
blow down the fruit, should be the aim of cultivators.
Planting in a valley should be avoided on account of spring
frosts. In Planting, care must be taken to make the
bottom of the hole tolerably firm, and slightly raised under
the base or bole of the tree. The roots should then be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
carefully spread out all round, and if any have been
ruptured in transplanting, cut them clean off on the
upper side, thus inducing new roots to be formed near
the surface. The soil should be trodden firmly after a
quantity has been filled in, if it is in a dry, suitable
condition, as previously recommended. Secure with stakes
in proportion to the size of tree, or injury will be caused
by the wind. The distance at which Apple trees are
planted varies considerably. Standards in orchards may
be planted in good soil, from 20ft. to 40ft. apart,
especially if they are strong-growing culinary sorts.
Pyramids may be planted from 5ft. to 15ft., according to
size; and similar distances will suit Bush trees. The oblique
Cordon system of training admits of a large number
of varieties being cultivated in a small space, as they
may be planted as close as 18in. or 2ft. apart. Horizontal
Cordons should be planted about 5ft. asunder,
and one branch trained each way. Watering will be
necessary after planting in most cases, especially should
the winter and following season be at all dry. Thinning
the fruit is sometimes advisable for obtaining good specimens,
but it is not generally necessary, at least with many
of the shy-setting sorts. If, however, the crop should be
exceptionally heavy, it is best to thin the fruit, or the
tree may be unable to make and ripen its wood for the
crop of the succeeding year.</p>

<p><em>Gathering.</em> The three following tests are sure indications
of the gathering period: (1) The apples will begin to fall
of their own accord; (2) their seeds will be plump and
brown in colour; and (3) the fruit will separate with a mere
touch from the trees; the second test may be said to be
infallible. All Apples should be gathered before the end of
October, for none will bear frost with impunity. They
must be gathered in dry weather, and handled with the
greatest care, laid gently in baskets and trays, in single file
only, and conveyed to the store room.</p>

<p><em>Storing.</em> The simplest and best method is in choosing
or forming some room or place free from extremes of heat
and cold, dryness or damp, where a temperature of about
45deg. is maintained. A current of air is not necessary.
The shelves should be made of poplar, sycamore, lime, or
other white wood. Deal, oak, ash, elm, and almost all other
woods, give a bad taste to the fruit. One sheet of paper&mdash;and
paper only&mdash;should be placed under the fruit. They
ripen best, and are of the highest flavour when left fully
exposed to the free atmosphere of the fruit room, and in
order to preserve a more even temperature the light should
be shut out. Early and late ripening varieties must be
stored in separate places, as well as all inferior or injured
fruit. The plan of isolating each fruit by packing in
tissue paper, sand, burnt earth, or other substances, often
destroys the flavour of the fruit, and possesses no material
benefit otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>APPLE BERRY.</strong> <em>See</em> <a href="#BILLARDIERA"><strong>Billardiera</strong>.</a></p>

<p><a name="APPLE_BLOSSOM_WEEVIL" id="APPLE_BLOSSOM_WEEVIL"></a><strong>APPLE-BLOSSOM WEEVIL</strong> (<em>Anthonomus pomorum</em>).
This is a small beetle of a reddish-brown colour,
with three inconspicuous stripes of a paler colour behind
the head; the wing cases show a large pitchy-coloured
blotch, with oblique stri√¶ and yellowish spots thereon.
The female busily engages herself in piercing the flower
buds; while the male may be usually seen flying about the
trees during the breeding season, which, of course, varies
according to the earlier or later expansion of the buds.
The female, by means of strong jaws at the end of the long
proboscis, bores a hole in the bud, in which she lays a
single egg, finally closing the opening, then passing on
to other buds. The laying season lasts for two or three
weeks, or, indeed, as long as the buds remain unexpanded;
eggs are never laid in open blossoms. In warm weather,
the eggs are hatched in six or seven days, usually about
the end of April, into small, white, legless maggots, which
feed upon the stamens and pistil; hence, although the
petals are normally coloured, and expand, the flowers
ultimately wither, and in some seasons very serious consequences
have arisen from these injurious little pests.
The maggot is fleshy, whitish, with a few hairs and a
black, hard head; in a few days, it turns into a brown
chrysalis or pupa, which, in turn, is changed into the
Weevil, only about a month having elapsed from the
deposition of the egg till the Weevil is developed. It
feeds upon the foliage during summer, and hybernates in
crannies of the bark, or under the soil at the base of
the trees, during winter, waking up in the following spring
to go through the same performances as its parents.</p>

<p><em>Remedies.</em> Some of the methods advised for the extirpation
of the American Blight will prove very useful for
the destruction of this pest. Clear away all useless portions
of the bark and rubbish round about the tree during
the winter, and many will be destroyed. Place bandages
of tarred cloth around the stem in spring; this will
prevent the females crawling up, as they seldom fly. If
a white cloth is placed beneath the tree affected when
in bud, and the tree is severely shaken, a large number
will be caught, as the Weevil falls to the ground when
alarmed. Timely thinning of the trees, allowing the free
admission of light and air, is also a very effectual preventive,
as it has been proved that the greatest ravages
are committed where neglect of this has been the rule;
and that, on the other hand, in proportion to its being
done, the pest has been lessened in numbers.</p>

<p><a name="APPLE_MUSSEL_SCALE" id="APPLE_MUSSEL_SCALE"></a><strong>APPLE MUSSEL SCALE</strong> (<em>Aspidiotus conchiformis</em>).
This insect attacks the bark of Apple and Pear-trees.
It is in outward appearance like the half of a
mussel shell. Under the scale is the insect. It is
closely allied to the true scale insects, and has similar
habits. The scales are about ‚Öõin. long, brown, and wider
at one end than at the other. The female is like a fat,
green, fleshy maggot, without jointed limbs. The eggs
of this curious insect are not laid, but simply remain
in the body of the mother until she dies, thus leaving
a protecting shield or case from which the hatched
larv√¶ emerge. To get rid of this insect, therefore, the
females containing eggs should be destroyed. It differs
from most other species in the absence of the long tail
filaments. If numerous, this Scale causes the trees to
become sickly and unfruitful. It is difficult to extirpate.</p>

<p><em>Soft-soap Lather.</em> When the leaves fall, in autumn,
the trees should be treated with a stiff sash-tool, and all
the Scale rubbed off, keeping the brush just moist, and
not rubbing the buds. Applied for two seasons, this
should clear the trees. All loose bark should be removed.</p>

<p><em>Seal Oil</em> is sometimes recommended as a good remedy:
but oils are rather unsafe applications to the bark of
trees, especially of the young branches.</p>

<p><a name="APPLE_CODLIN_GRUB" id="APPLE_CODLIN_GRUB"></a><strong>APPLE OR CODLIN GRUB</strong> (<em>Carpocapsa pomonana</em>).
During the month of May, the well-known Codlin
Moth (see Fig. 127) lays its eggs in the calyces, usually
one in each, of the young, quickly-growing apple. The
moth itself is a small insect; the fore-wings are grey,
prettily speckled with delicate, darker streaks, and with
a curved golden mark on the hinder part, inclosing one
of a reddish-brown colour. The hind wings are usually
dark, as is also the body. The caterpillar, when
hatched, is white, with black head and neck, and with
four rows of black marks along the whole body. The
colours soon, however, become less decided, taking an
indistinct brownish or grey hue. After being hatched, the
caterpillar gnaws its way down the fruit, keeping clear of
the core, and gradually forces its gallery towards the rind
of the fruit, which it finally pierces, the opening serving as
the outlet for the dirt. When nearly full grown, it pierces
the core and feeds upon the pips, which injury speedily
causes the fruit to drop. The insect then emerges therefrom,
and finds a suitable shelter in a cranny of the bark,
where it spins a cocoon; and, according to British authorities,
it remains in the larval state for some weeks, finally
assuming the chrysalis form, and thus passing the winter;
the moth emerges the following season. Shortly after
development, the moths pair, the female depositing eggs
in the fruit in June or July, according to the season.</p>

<p>Practically, there is no preventive; but the following
hints will serve to greatly reduce the numbers. All
apples that fall ere they are ripe should be picked up
as promptly as possible, and be given to the pigs; or
pigs should be turned into the orchard to clear off the
fallen fruit. The following is the only serviceable remedy:</p>

<p><em>Hayband Trap.</em> This is simply a loosely made hayband
twisted around the stems of the trees, about 1ft. from
the ground. The grubs, in searching for a suitable place
in which to make a cocoon, will generally choose the bands.
At the end of the season, all the haybands should be collected
and burnt, and the stems of the trees from which
they were removed should be cleared of any cocoons which
may adhere to them. All loose bark and other rubbish
should be removed from the tree trunks, and also from
the ground below.</p>

<p><strong>APPLE OR CODLIN GRUB TRAP.</strong> An exceedingly
ingenious and effective method of alluring that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
obnoxious pest, the Apple Grub. The trap (Fig. 128) consists
of two, three, or more thin pieces of board, 12in. to
20in. in length, and 2in. to 4in. wide, with a screw (<em>a</em>)
through their centre. The screw must be long enough to
be firmly driven into the trunk of the tree, so as to hold the
boards in position. Small slips of wood (<em>b</em>) are inserted
between the boards, to keep them sufficiently open to allow
of the entry of the grubs, as shown at <em>d</em>. The boards are
cut on each side of the screw, as at <em>c</em>, to facilitate their
separation when fastened together by the silken threads of
the grubs, and to better expose the latter when the trap is
opened. This handy trap, which is of American origin, is
very cheap. A great number of them may be collected
with little trouble, submitted to a killing heat, and replaced
again; and they can be used either on the ground or
on the trees. As regards killing the grubs when caught,
Mr Weir, the inventor, says: "The quickest and best
way is to have a large tin pan, bent in on one side, so
as to fit closely to the trunk of the tree. When you reach
the tree, drop upon your knees, place the depression in the
pan against the trunk of the tree, hold it there by pressing
your body against it, and you have both hands free to open
the trap. When opening it, many of the pup√¶ or chrysalids
will fall into the pan. The trap must be turned clear
around, as many will be found between it and the bark. A
person will open and kill the worms in from four hundred
to eight hundred traps in a day."</p>

<p><a name="APRICOT" id="APRICOT"></a><strong>APRICOT</strong> (<em>Armeniaca vulgaris</em>). The Apricot, or, as
it was formerly written, "Abricock," is a much esteemed
and luscious fruit. It is said to have been introduced into
this country during the reign of Henry VIII. The Apricot
is one of the earliest flowering of fruit-trees (see Fig. 129),
and is generally in bloom during February. This fact is a
great drawback, as it is a difficult matter to save the flowers
from destruction by the spring winds and frosts. The fruit
(see Fig. 130) contains less acid than most stone fruits, and
in appearance it is perhaps the handsomest of all. Success
with its culture in many gardens is by no means certain,
but with careful preparation of borders and protection of
the flowers in spring, satisfactory results are often obtained.
Large quantities of fruit are annually imported to this
country from France; but their quality and flavour cannot
be compared with that of good home-grown produce.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Propagation</em> is effected by seeds or budding. The stones,
selected from the best varieties, may be sown as soon as the
fruit is ripe, in August or September, in light rich soil, and
covered with about 2in. of earth, over which a little litter
should be spread during winter. After one season's growth,
the plants should be lifted, and the tap roots slightly cut
back if the trees are intended for walls. They should then
be planted in nursery lines, allowing about a yard between
the rows, and 2ft. from plant to plant.</p>

</div>

<p>Budding is the most general mode of propagating Apricots.
They are frequently budded from the beginning to
the middle of June on seedling, and also on plum stocks,
of which latter the Mussell, Saint Julien, Brussels, and
Black Damson are the best. For dwarf trees, the stock
should be budded about 1ft. from the ground. There are
many disadvantages in having a great length of stem.
"Rider" trees require a stem from 3¬Ωft. to 6ft.; half-riders,
2¬Ωft. to 3ft. Grafting by the Whip method is sometimes employed,
but, for many reasons, it is much inferior to Budding.</p>

<p><em>Planting, &amp;c.</em> South-west and western aspects suit the
Apricot best, but the fruit has been ripened in warm
localities on walls facing several points north. Large areas
of garden wall (see Figs. 131 and 132), the walls of stables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
barns, outbuildings, and two sides of at least hundreds of
cottages, might thus be utilised for the cultivation of this
tree. If well drained, almost any garden soil will bring
these fruits to perfection; light, fibrous, rather sandy loam
will, however, prove most satisfactory. There should be
a considerable depth of soil; a yard is not too much,
provided it be on a dry base, which is most important.
Heavy soils may be improved for Apricot culture by the
addition of an equal portion of light loam, mortar rubbish,
or charred refuse. In furnishing walls, the distance apart
may vary from 2ft. between Cordons, to 12ft., 15ft., or
even 20ft. between Fan-shaped trees. The roots should be
carefully arranged, interlayered at all points with fine soil,
and the whole covered to a depth of 3in. or 4in. Not only
should the roots have a good covering of suitable earth, but
a secondary one of litter, or other light material, should
be added, to render them frost proof in winter, and drought
and heat proof in summer. Newly planted trees should, on
no account, be allowed to get dry at the root. A thorough
soaking of soft rain, or manure water, will often save a
crop, and restore the trees, when all other surface remedies
or appliances fail. Surface sprinklings overhead with
the garden engine, in the afternoons of bright days, are
beneficial, and help to keep the foliage clean and healthy.
So soon as the trees are cleared of their fruit, attention
should be directed to the maturation of the wood. All
superfluous shoots should be removed, any excess of growth
left on the shoots cut back, and every effort made to
perfect the wood already made, rather than force the tree
to make more. Unless the weather be very dry, water
should not be applied after this stage.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Protection.</em> It is almost hopeless to expect a crop unless
the blossoms are protected, by mats or other means, from
spring frosts. Temporary wooden copings, from 1ft. to 2ft.
wide, laid on iron brackets, are indispensable for warding off
storms, and keeping other coverings away from the flowers.
These should not be put up till the trees are just bursting
into bloom, and may safely be removed about the end of
May. A few fish or other nets, spread over the trees, afford
considerable resistance to the radiation of heat. This is
assuredly one of the easiest, if not one of the most efficient,
modes of protection. Frigi-domo and other thick shadings
are sometimes used, but they require to be removed from
the trees in the day time. The thinner nets mentioned are
generally not in use for other purposes at this time of
year, and may remain over the trees altogether. Glass
copings are the best, but, being rather expensive, they
cannot be used by the majority of cultivators. They
have, however, been applied with good results to trees that
had previously failed.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Cropping, &amp;c.</em> Thinning of the fruit needs early and
careful attention. The average of 3in. apart may be chosen
for a maximum yield. As the fruit approach maturity,
overhanging leaves, or branches of young wood, must be
removed, to admit sun and light to properly ripen and
colour them. Apricots for preserving should be gathered
quite dry, and with the sun upon them. For dessert, they
should be plucked in the morning, and placed in a cool
room till wanted.</p>

<p><em>Under Glass.</em> The Apricot will hardly bear forcing. It
is more sensitive to heat than almost any other of our
semi-hardy fruits. Practically, it is found that a confined
atmosphere, or the slightest excess of heat, brings its blooms
off in showers, and this, of course, mars all prospect of
fruit. But in cold climates and northern latitudes under
glass is the best and only means of growing them. Should
red-spider appear, it is proof that the roots or the atmosphere,
probably both, have been too dry; more moisture,
and syringing over the leaves, are the surest remedies. The
borders need to be about 2ft. or 2ft. 6in. deep, of any light
rich soil. Fresh planted trees should be frequently syringed
overhead before and after the flowering period. After they
have become fully established, less overhead sprinkling is
needed. During all the earlier stages of growth, and until
the fruit are stoned, an artificial temperature of 45deg.
should not be exceeded. After that stage, the fruit will
bear a heat of 50deg. or 55deg. It is hardly safe or
desirable to exceed the latter under glass, and unless
abundance of air is given, 55deg. may bring off the fruit,
even at an advanced stage. A thorough soaking, at
intervals of fourteen days during the height of the growing
season, may be applied; and, should the trees be heavily
cropped, manure water may be given at every alternate
watering. It is also a good practice to mulch the surface
of heavily cropped trees with 3in. or 4in. of good dung.
The fruit should, however, be freely thinned to distances
of from 4in. to 6in. apart at the most. There are three
general methods of growing them under glass: The trees
may be trained on trellises or walls; grown as natural
standards, tall or dwarf; and as bushes, either planted
out or in pots.</p>

<p><em>Varieties.</em> The varieties of Apricot, unlike most other
fruit, are not numerous; and the following will be found in
every way representative and satisfactory:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>Blanche</strong>, or <strong>White Masculine</strong>. A small and delicate fruited
sort. Fruit pale whitish-yellow, tinged with brownish-red next the
sun, covered with a fine white down; rich, delicate, and sugary.</p>

<p><strong>Blenheim</strong>, or <strong>Shipley's</strong>.* Very early and prolific. Colour
deep yellow; flesh medium, rich, and juicy. Ripe in July.</p>

<p><strong>Breda.</strong>* A small sort, of excellent quality. Colour deep orange;
flesh firm, juicy, and rich. Hardiest sort grown.</p>

<p><strong>Kaisha.</strong>* Fruit round, much smaller than Moorpark. Colour pale
citron; flesh tender, rich, juicy; flavour delicate and delicious;
kernel very sweet.</p>

<p><strong>Large Red.</strong> The deepest coloured of all. Fruit very large;
colour deep reddish-orange; flesh rich and juicy; kernel bitter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Moorpark.</strong>* The sort most generally grown; large, handsome,
and of excellent quality. Colour brownish-orange; flesh rich,

<p><a name="AQUATIC_PLANTS" id="AQUATIC_PLANTS"></a><strong>AQUATIC PLANTS.</strong> The culture of Aquatic Plants,
both indoors and in the open air, has been greatly neglected
of late years; they are, therefore, rarely seen to perfection
in places other than where their culture is made a speciality.
Generally speaking, they are most easily grown. The
following stove and greenhouse genera are well worth attention:
<em>Aponogeton</em>, <em>Cyperus</em>, <em>Damasonium</em>, <em>Herpestis</em>,
<em>Limnocharis</em>, <em>Nelumbium</em>, <em>Nymph≈ìa</em>, <em>Ouvirandra</em>, <em>Pistia</em>,
<em>Pontederia</em>, <em>Salvinia</em>, <em>Thalia</em>, <em>Trianea</em>, <em>Victoria</em>. Many
species belonging to some of the foregoing genera are
hardy, as are also the following: <em>Alisma</em>, <em>Butomus</em>, <em>Calla</em>,
<em>Hottonia</em>, <em>Menyanthes</em>, <em>Nuphar</em>, <em>Polygonum</em>, <em>Sagittaria</em>,

Erect hardy perennial herbs with fibrous roots. Flowers solitary
or panicled, drooping; sepals five, petaloid, deciduous;
petals five, concave, spurred; spurs very large, produced
downwards into hollow tubes, and frequently curved at
the extremity; carpels five, sessile, free. Radical leaves
on long stalks, twice or thrice ternate, with trifid-toothed,
usually blunt segments. Too much praise can scarcely be
lavished upon this elegant genus of plants. They prefer
a moist and sheltered situation, with exposure to the
sun. The more robust species will thrive in ordinary
garden soil, but the rarer and more delicate kinds
require a good friable sandy loam and leaf soil, with good
drainage. Seed is produced in abundance, and must be
sown very thinly, as soon as practicable after being ripe,
in a shady place or in pans in a cold frame. When up,
and strong enough to remove, the seedlings may be
planted out where they are to bloom, allowing every
plant at least 9in. each way. The strong-growing kinds
may be placed in the border, the dwarf ones on the
rockery. When in bloom, the inferior sorts should be
weeded out, retaining only the best varieties. To obtain
seed true of any species, it is absolutely necessary to plant
the separate kinds far apart, and cover them with fine
muslin, to prevent the access of insects to the flowers, as
none are more easily cross-fertilised. Division of the root
is the only way to perpetuate any particular variety with
certainty, unless seed is saved in the way mentioned, or
imported from the native habitats of particular species.
There are many beautiful hybrids, as well as species, in
cultivation.</p>

Rock Cress. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Crucifer√¶</em>. Hardy perennial trailers,
except where otherwise stated. Flowers mostly white;
racemes terminal; pedicels bractless. Radical leaves usually
stalked; cauline ones sessile or stem-clasping, entire or
toothed, rarely lobed. Most members of this genus are
peculiarly well adapted for rockwork and the alpine garden,
both from their natural hardihood as well as their early and
profuse flowering habits. They are of the easiest possible
culture in any dry soil. The perennial species may either
be increased by divisions of the root, by cuttings, placed
in a shady border during the summer, or by seed. The
latter may be sown outside, or in pans, in spring, when
most of them will germinate in two or three weeks. The
annuals and biennials are for the most part devoid of any

calyx a long tube, with a bilabiate limb; ovary
stipitate, inclosed in the tube of the calyx; the stipe

to a sufficient size, they should be potted off singly, and
placed among other stove annuals. After the plant has
finished flowering, and the pods begin to lengthen, the pedicels
force them into the earth, where they ripen their seeds.</p>

<p><a name="ARALIA" id="ARALIA"></a><strong>ARALIA</strong> (meaning unknown). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Araliace√¶</em>. This
widely-grown genus includes stove, greenhouse, and hardy,
herbaceous and shrubby plants. Flowers inconspicuous,
umbellate, the umbels usually disposed in panicles; petals
five, inserted on the margin of the disk; stamens five
(see Fig. 142). Leaves usually compound. These plants are
of moderately free growth, and the majority are easy to
manage. Those requiring indoor treatment thrive well
under the ordinary routine of management. One most important
requirement, however, is that they must be kept
well supplied with water at the roots. The finer, or stove
varieties, should be potted in a mixture of sandy loam and
peat, with the addition of a little fibrous leaf soil, and
sufficient sand to keep the whole porous. The stronger
growing kinds thrive in a richer compost. Propagation
by cuttings of the roots is a common and very successful
method. To obtain the roots, one of the strongest plants
should be turned out of the pot, and the roots should
be cleared of soil by shaking or washing it out; the
requisite number of pieces should then be selected.
As each piece is removed, it should have the end nearest
the stem cut horizontally, to distinguish it from the other
or furthermost end. In planting cuttings of the roots,
it is best to place the end nearest the stem uppermost.
The pieces may be left about 2in. long, and should be
inserted in pots, well drained, and filled with sandy soil,
leaving the tops of the cuttings about level with the surface
of the soil. A square of glass must be placed over the top
of each pot, plunging them in moderate bottom heat. The
stems of the plants from which the roots have been taken
may be cut into pieces 1in. or 1¬Ωin. long, leaving an eye or
bud near the top; a slice of half the shoot may be taken off
opposite the bud. When prepared, these pieces should be
pressed into pots of sand or sandy soil, and plunged into
bottom heat. The stems may be cut down without disturbing
the roots; in that case, if the pots are plunged in
bottom heat, and kept moderately supplied with water,
they will probably throw up several suckers or shoots from
the roots. These, if taken off with a portion of root to
each, and placed in small sized pots, will, with a little
care, soon make useful plants. All the hardy species and
most of the greenhouse ones are propagated readily by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
cuttings or pieces of roots. Some of the stove species,
however, are very difficult to increase, except by grafting.
Among these are <a href="#A_LEPTOPHYLLA"><em>A. leptophylla</em>,</a> <a href="#A_VEITCHII"><em>A. Veitchii</em>,</a> &amp;c. These
should be worked on stocks of <a href="#A_GUILFOYLEI"><em>A. Guilfoylei</em></a> or <a href="#A_RETICULATA"><em>A. reticulata</em>,</a>
the latter being the better of the two. Cuttings of either of
these strike readily, and stocks fit for grafting are easily
procured. In sheltered and warm positions, the greenhouse
species are admirably suited for sub-tropical gardening,
either planted singly or in groups. <em>See</em> also <strong>Dimorphanthus</strong>,

di≈ìcious or sub-di≈ìcious evergreen trees, with usually

cones large, cylindrical, terminal; female ones very large,
globular, terminal, with dense ligneous deciduous scales,
each bearing a solitary seed. The majority of the species

winters out of doors. Few trees can compete with them in
symmetry and elegant proportion for conservatory decoration,
where they may be grown in large tubs, or planted
out. Small plants grown in pots are most serviceable for
table and other decorative purposes. They thrive in a
good fibrous loam, mixed with leaf soil and sand. Propagation
by means of seed is the surest and most satisfactory
method; the seed should be sown in pans or boxes, or if in
large quantities, in a bed, with but gentle heat; they
usually take some time to germinate. Cuttings are procured
by taking off the leading shoots, and fixing them firmly in a
pot of sand; they first require a cool place, but may afterwards
be subjected to slight warmth. When rooted, they
should be potted off into the soil above mentioned. The
young growths which afterwards shoot from the plant,
whence the cutting, may be taken off and treated in much
the same manner. These are the only methods of propagation
worth pursuing.</p>

<em>Myrsine√¶</em>. An extensive genus of greenhouse or stove,
mostly ornamental, evergreen trees and shrubs. Flowers
white or rose-coloured, more or less panicled; panicles
sometimes many-flowered at the extremities of the
branches, and longer than the leaves, sometimes few-flowered
and in the axils of the leaves. Leaves alternate,
rarely almost opposite, or three in a whorl, dotted. Propagated
by cuttings of the half-ripened wood taken from the
side shoots of the plant any time from March to September;
but, as the points of these side shoots bear the blossoms
and fruit, they are not well adapted for making good plants.
To obtain the best plants, the largest, ripest, and best-coloured
berries should be sown early in spring, as soon as
gathered, in a wide-mouthed pot or seed pan, well drained
and filled with loam and peat in equal parts, with the
addition of some sand, and plunged in bottom heat, the
soil being kept moderately moist. The seeds will germinate
in a few weeks after sowing, and when about 2in. high,
the strongest seedlings should be selected and placed in
3in. pots, the same mixture of soil being used, with the addition
of a fourth part well decomposed manure. After
potting, the plants must be moistened overhead twice a
day with a fine rose or syringe, and be kept in a close
atmosphere until the roots have taken to the fresh soil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
When the plants begin to grow again, they should be
removed to a light situation in the house; and when the
pots are well filled with roots, a shift into 6in. pots may
be effected, water being given judiciously until well established,
and here they may remain to fruit. Until the
berries are coloured, clear manure water, given once or
twice a week, will be found beneficial. The plants arrive
at their best when about 18in. or 2ft. high; after that,
they begin to get naked at the bottom. It will then be
wise to cut the worst plants down to within 2in. of the
pots, in early spring, allowing them to become dry at
the roots before this operation is performed. By giving
moisture to the roots when the cut has become dry, the
plants will soon break into growth again, when some of
the worst placed shoots should be rubbed off, leaving only
one or two of the strongest and best placed, calculated to
develop into a well formed plant. When the shoots have
grown 2in. or 3in., the plants should be turned out of their
pots, the soil shaken out from the roots, and the long
ends of the roots trimmed in a little with a knife; they
must then be placed in a pot sufficiently large to hold the
roots without squeezing. The plants should now occupy
the warmest end of the house in which they are grown, care
being taken in watering until new roots are formed, when
they may have more air and somewhat liberal supplies
of water. As soon as they are sufficiently advanced in
growth, they should be transferred to a larger-sized pot.
With proper treatment, they will flower and fruit the same
season as they are cut down, and form handsome plants.
Although most species of this genus are classed as stove
plants, they will succeed very well in a temperature that does
not fall below 45deg. in winter; and, when so grown,
they are not so liable to become infested with large brown
scale and other insect pests. This is particularly the case

unisexual, borne upon the same spike; female flowers
having six rudimentary stamens, and male flowers a six-cleft
perianth. Fruit one-seeded. They thrive in a compost
of loam, peat, and leaf soil, in equal parts, with a
liberal addition of sand; but when they are fully grown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
loam should preponderate to the extent of about two-thirds,
and some rotten cow-manure may be added. Propagated
from seeds, which should be sown in a compost
similar to above, and placed in a moist gentle heat. They
are employed, when young, with much success for the
decoration of drawing rooms and dinner tables.</p>

consisting of about 150 species. It is distinguished by
having generally three styles. The perennials only are
worth growing; these are extremely pretty little alpine
plants, and will thrive in any ordinary soil in exposed
places; the rarer species may be grown in small pots, well

Birthwort. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Aristolochiace√¶</em>. A very large
genus of stove, greenhouse, or hardy, evergreen or deciduous,
climbing or erect shrubs. Flowers axillary, clustered,
or solitary, pendulous, of most extraordinary forms;
perianth tubular, curved, or straight, with an oblique,
cordate limb; stamens six, rarely four, or numerous, adhering
to the stigma; capsule six-valved. Leaves cordate
entire or lobed. Good loam, with a small proportion of
decayed manure and a slight addition of sharp sand to
secure efficient drainage, is a good compost for the whole.
They will thrive when planted out in the conservatory
more satisfactorily than elsewhere; for as they usually
grow a considerable height before flowering, they require
very long trellises in pots, and have to be trained up and
down; or, better still, round a pillar of uniform circumference,
a pyramid form being useless. The best way
is to train them round, close down to the pot, and keep
on about 2in. from one turn to the next. Some of the
larger sorts will require more room. Cuttings root freely
in sand under a bell glass with bottom heat.</p>

Handsome hardy herbaceous perennials or annuals, allied
to <em>Lithospermum</em>. Cuttings should be removed with a
heel in autumn, dibbled in sandy soil in small pots, and
placed in a cool house, where they will ultimately, though
slowly, root; they should then be gradually hardened off,
and finally planted out. <em>A. echioides</em> is also easily increased
by making cuttings of the strong roots, which
should be dibbled in pots of sandy soil, and placed in gentle
heat; it is also raised from seed.</p>

<p><em>Preparation of Soil.</em> Trench the ground two spits deep
if possible, mixing a liberal dressing of well-rotted manure
in autumn, and ridge up for the winter, to sweeten. Crude
manure full of straw, leaves, and sticks, often induce fungoid
growths, and are most injurious to the crowns of the plants.
Clay or stiff loam is about the worst soil on which to attempt
the culture of this vegetable; this drawback may, however,
to some extent be alleviated by the addition and thorough
amalgamation of a light free soil or liberal dressings of
sandy road drifts, or similar materials. An ill-drained soil
is also fatal to good results. During hot, dry weather, the
plants are greatly benefited by copious applications of clear
water and dilute liquid manure; and this must be especially
attended to on such soils as are liable to burn or dry up in
summer.</p>

<p><em>Cultivation.</em> When the beds have been properly prepared,
the plants should be put in them in April or May.
Place three together in rows between 3ft. and 4ft. apart,
and about 3ft. from plant to plant. Water-in carefully
to settle the soil around the roots, and apply a mulching
of half-decayed manure, to prevent an undue evaporation
of moisture. During hot, dry weather, give
liberal supplies of water, and the plants will become established
as fine stools the first season. A few heads will
probably be produced the first year; but there will not be
much of a crop until the second season, when five or six
good heads will be got from each plant, and for three or four
years the produce will be large if the beds are properly
attended to; after which time it will become desirable to
make up new plantations. In October or November, it will
be necessary to apply a good mulching of straw or fern to
the beds, to protect the plants from frost. In April, all
this litter should be cleaned off, a dressing of rotten manure
applied, and the beds forked over and kept clean for the
rest of the season, treating as before described. Great
care must be taken to remove the heads as soon as they
are in a fit state; and, when the whole of them are removed
from the stems, cut the latter out as low as possible.
Globe Artichokes will keep for some considerable time if
laid in a cool place, although they will deteriorate in
quality. These plants may be used in the background of
flower borders in the kitchen garden, their handsome foliage
being peculiarly well adapted for such purposes, whilst their
economical value is also secured. See Fig. 151. Where
there is plenty of room in light, warm sheds, orchard houses,
or other places where frost can be kept out, some stools can
be taken up with the root intact in the early part of November,
placed in boxes of soil, and well watered-in. When
drained, the boxes may be put in any of those positions
for their winter quarters, and, if kept moist,
will develop much earlier than the outdoor crops,
provided they are planted out early in April on a
warm border, and protected with mats when the
weather is cold. Propagation may be effected by
seeds, or by suckers from the old stools, the latter
being the better plan. In the former case, sow the
seeds in March, on a gentle hotbed, and prick the
seedlings off singly, when large enough, into small
pots. Harden off by the last week in May, and
plant out in threes as previously recommended,
protecting the plants from late frosts. During the
growing season, give an abundance of water and liquid
manure mulching, to prevent undue evaporation.
In November, well cover with dry litter which will
not heat; and, in hard frosts, or heavy snow, throw
a few mats over the beds, uncovering at the same
time as recommended above for the older plants.
To propagate by rooted offsets or suckers, take up
and divide the stools, when they have made a fair
amount of growth in April or early in May, separating
the suckers with as many roots and as much soil
adhering to them as possible. The old woody portions
are of little use, but they may be replanted to
give off a fresh supply of suckers for the next year, if
required. Propagation by suckers, if they are to be obtained,
has many advantages; but care must be taken, in
removing them from old plants, that some roots are attached,
or growth will be uncertain. Seeds generally produce a
large percentage of plants that are useless, and this is not
found out until the flower-heads appear. On the other
hand, suckers reproduce the parent plant, and if these are
previously selected, the superior stock is thereby perpetuated.</p>

<p><strong>ARTICHOKE, JERUSALEM</strong> (<em>Helianthus tuberosus</em>).
A hardy tuberous-rooted herbaceous perennial,
native of Brazil. The roots are used as a vegetable principally
during the winter, sometimes as a dish, but more
generally for flavouring purposes. Plants will grow in
almost any position, but the best results and largest tubers
are obtained where they receive plenty of room and liberal
treatment. Their culture has been recommended as a
substitute for the potato, but they are not likely to take the
place of this vegetable, the flavour being disliked by many
persons. A few are, however, generally acceptable.</p>

<p><em>Cultivation.</em> To ensure the most successful results,
trench over a piece of ground in autumn, and give a
light dressing of manure. Fork over in March; at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
same time plant good-shaped tubers (see Fig. 152) in rows
about 3ft. apart, and allow from 18in. to 2ft. between the
tubers in the rows. Keep clear of weeds; and, as soon as the
foliage is yellow, in the latter part of the autumn, the roots
will be fit for use. The best plan with this crop is to leave
it in the ground till wanted, or till the end of February,
and then to take up every tuber, replanting those which
are wanted for stock, and storing the others away in a cold
dry place. When they commence
growth, they turn black, and are of
little use for cooking, save for flavouring
soups. This vegetable has
of late years grown into favour as a
marketable crop, and the demand
seems to be increasing. Considering
its very easy culture, it is fairly remunerative.

O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Aroide√¶</em>. A large genus of ornamental

thick rhizomes and pedate or hastate leaves. Spathe
large, convolute; spadix naked and club-shaped at the

will thrive with such treatment as is given to <em>Alocasias</em>,
<em>Caladiums</em>, &amp;c. Rich soil is one of the first conditions
of success. Like most plants grown for the beauty of
their foliage, rapid and free growth is necessary. A compost
of good rich loam, with a third of sweet manure,
thoroughly rotted, or leaf mould, with some sharp sand,
is very suitable. Plenty of moisture is necessary during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the growing season, after which the tender kinds should be kept moderately
dry, warm, and at rest during the winter. The hardy kinds may be left in
the ground. Propagated by seeds or division of the roots&mdash;usually
the latter. The best time to divide them is just as they commence their
new growth, securing as many roots as possible to each division. Any
rootless pieces should be placed in heat shortly after removal; this
hastens the formation of roots and excites top growth. Arums are useful
in sub-tropical gardening, and are otherwise interesting plants both for
indoors and outside cultivation; and the hardy kinds are very suitable
for naturalising in woodlands, &amp;c. There are many other species
besides those here described, but the following list comprises the best.

A very ornamental group of half or quite hardy plants, of

many-flowered; corolla of two very unequal valves; all,
except the lower and imperfect one, surrounded by a tuft

of 12ft. New Zealand, 1843. This fine species grows in dense
tufts, from which arise numerous leathery, narrow, smooth (or
slightly rough), long curving leaves, and erect, slender culms.
The plant is not sufficiently hardy to withstand a severe winter,
and should, therefore, be protected with mats, or be grown in
tubs, so that it can be removed under shelter before the approach
of winter. These precautions are unnecessary in the more
southern counties of England.</p>

ornamental, glaucous green, arching. <em>h.</em> about 12ft. South
Europe, 1648. This also requires protection during winter in the
colder counties. See Fig. 156.</p>

<p><strong>A. D. versicolor</strong> (various-coloured).* <em>h.</em> 3ft. South Europe.
Although much smaller, this variety is far superior to the type
for gardening purposes, and has its leaves ribboned with white.
It requires a deep, well drained, sandy loam to thrive well, and
a thorough winter protection of cocoa-fibre refuse or coal
ashes. For isolated tufts or groups, few plants can equal it.
It is propagated by placing a stem in water, which induces
little rooted plants to start from the joints; these should be
separated, potted off, and kept in frames until thoroughly
established.</p>

herbaceous or sub-shrubby perennials, except where otherwise
specified. Corolla five-parted, reflexed; umbels interpetiolar;
corona seated on the upper part of the tube
of the filaments, five-leaved. Leaves opposite, verticillate,
sometimes alternate. Most of the hardy species
are very handsome border plants, thriving in peaty,
or light rich soil, and are increased by dividing the
roots in spring, and sometimes also by seeds. The doubtfully
hardy or rarer species should always be grown in
a peat soil, and have a little protection during severe frost,
by mulching the roots. The most important of the greenhouse
and stove species is <em>A. curassavica</em>. In order to
obtain good bushy specimens of this, it will be necessary to
cut the plants back annually, after keeping them slightly
dry, and resting for a month or two in midwinter. When
growth has sufficiently advanced, they should be shaken out
and repotted. At this stage, a close, moist atmosphere will
be needful to produce the usually very free growth. The
points of the shoots must be nipped out, in order to promote
a bushy habit. When the pots have become filled
with roots, liquid manure may be applied; but it must be
quite clear and not over strong. All the indoor species
grow best in good fibry loam and leaf mould, and require to
be potted firmly. Cuttings should be secured in spring,
struck in gentle heat, under a bell glass, and as soon as
they are well rooted, potted into 60-size pots. A shift
must be given as often as the pots become filled with
roots, up to the time when the plant commences flowering.
Seeds may be sown in pots in spring, pricked out
singly when large enough, and then treated similarly to
cuttings.</p>

A genus of elegant little herbs and sub-shrubs, with
sessile, entire leaves, destitute of pellucid dots, but usually
furnished with black dots beneath. Flowers resembling
<em>Hypericum</em>. They require to be protected during winter
by a frame; for this purpose they should be grown in pots,
as they never exist long in the open border. A compost of
peat, pure leaf soil, and sand, in equal portions, suits them
well; young cuttings of the shrubby kinds will root in
sand under a hand bell glass. Propagated by careful
divisions of the roots in spring. All may be raised from
seeds.</p>

<p><a name="ASHES" id="ASHES"></a><strong>ASHES.</strong> The earthy or mineral particles of combustible
substances, remaining after combustion. Ashes
are amongst the most economical manures.</p>

<p><em>Vegetable Ashes</em> are generally the best application for
manuring boggy, cold, and, consequently, sour and unprofitable
land, in quantities of about forty bushels per acre,
thinly and evenly distributed. The annual exhaustion of
salts from large crops of grain, roots, and grass, is from
180lb. to more than 250lb. per acre; and the aggregate of
a few years will so far impoverish the soil in one or more
of the principles necessary to sustain a luxuriant vegetation,
that it will cease to yield remunerating returns. The ashes
of vegetables consist of such elements as are always required
for their perfect maturity, and it is evident they
must furnish one of the best saline manures which can be
supplied for their growth; they contain, in fact, every
element, and generally in the right proportions, for insuring
a full and rapid growth. Both gardener and farmer will
therefore perceive the great value of Ashes to their crops.</p>

<p><em>Coal Ashes.</em> The bituminous and anthracite coals afford
Ashes, and, although inferior in quality to those made from
wood and vegetables, are, like them, a valuable manure, and
they should be applied to the land in a similar manner. If
they contain many cinders, from not having been thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
burned, they are more suited to heavy than to light soils.
Coal Ashes, if very fine, may be sprinkled half an inch deep
on the surface, over peas and beans, &amp;c., to preserve them
from mice; they may also be used for garden and greenhouse
walks, where bricks or tiles are absent, being tidy
in appearance, and an excellent substitute for other and
more expensive material.</p>

<p><em>Peat Ashes.</em> Peat approaching to purity, when thrown
out of its bed and thoroughly dried, may be burned to an
imperfect Ash, and when it does not reach this point, it will
become thoroughly charred, and reduced to cinders. The
process of burning should be as slow as possible. In either
form, it is a valuable dressing for the soil.</p>

Hardy shrubs, with oblong, cuneated, usually deciduous
leaves. Flowers sometimes rising before the leaves,
usually solitary and axillary. They thrive freely in a

Leaves of three to five leaflets, disposed palmately,
rarely pinnately, having scarcely any or very short petioles.
All the species are pretty when in flower, and thrive in a
mixture of loam, peat, and sand. Young cuttings of
half-ripened wood will strike in April, in sand, under
bell glasses, which must be wiped dry occasionally. But
little water is needed. Over a hundred species are

very small scale-like leaves, and a profusion of numerous
slender fascicled-needle, rather spiny branchlets. Flowers
axillary, inconspicuous. Fruit baccate. The indoor species
will all thrive well in a warm greenhouse temperature,
provided they have partial shade, a good supply of moisture
at the roots, and are not kept too close, in a moderately
rich sandy compost. The hardy species are propagated
chiefly by seeds and divisions of the roots. Rich sandy
loam is necessary, and otherwise they may be treated as
ordinary perennials. Some of the species belonging to this
genus are among the most elegant of foliage plants for
cutting purposes. <em>A. decumbens</em> and <em>A. scandens</em> make
excellent plants for Wardian cases, and may be cut in freely
if they exceed their limits.</p>

<p>A<span class="smcapa">SPARAGUS</span> (<em>A. officinalis</em>) <span class="smcapa">AS</span> <span class="smcapa">A</span> V<span class="smcapa">EGETABLE</span>. The value
and importance of this plant as a
vegetable cannot be over-estimated;
it is extensively grown, and, when
properly managed, produces a fairly
lucrative crop.</p>

<p><em>Soil and Bed.</em> The first thing to be
done in the preparation of an Asparagus
bed to stand for any length of time, is
to secure an efficient drainage; and on
wet soils this is best effected by placing
a layer of brick rubbish over the whole
of the bottom, and connecting this with
a drain. On gravelly or other soils
which are drained naturally, of course,
this is not needed; but if really good
crops are a <em>desideratum</em>, water should
not stand within 3ft. of the surface.
In all cases, the ground must be dug to
a depth of 18in., and, if stiff, a goodly
amount of road sweepings, or other gritty
materials, should be well mixed with
the staple soil. Asparagus requires a
good soil, neither too heavy nor too light.</p>

<p><em>Manuring.</em> After the soil has been
well trenched, and has lain long enough
to settle down, a good dressing of
manure&mdash;thoroughly rotted, and not
too rank, at the rate of from twenty
to thirty tons to the acre, dug into
the surface of the beds&mdash;will be found
very beneficial. If possible, this should
be introduced in January; and then, if
the weather permits, the beds should be forked two or three
times by the end of March, so as to render the soil as
friable as possible. A very good manure, and one that is
easily obtained, is common garden salt. This may be given
annually to established beds. A moderate dressing should
be applied just before growth commences in spring, but
a little will do no harm at other times during the
summer. It is best scattered on with the hand, and a
showery day should be selected, as it will then soon disappear.
Salt, besides acting as a manure, has also the
properties of keeping the beds cool and moist in hot
weather, and of preventing the growth of weeds.</p>

<p><em>Planting.</em> Asparagus can be planted during March and
April, the latter month being the best time for the
work. The soil having been thoroughly prepared, the
next point is to decide on the size of the beds; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
depends on the size of garden, and the class of "grass"
desired. When very large and fine stocks are the object in
view, the best results will accrue if the plants are fully a
yard apart each way; but this means a comparatively small
crop. A good plan is to make the beds 3ft. wide, planting
two rows, at a distance of 1ft. from each other, and allowing
18in. between each plant, placing them in alternate order.
An 18in. alley should be allowed between the beds. The
roots used for making the beds should be one year old, and
fresh from the ground. In planting, pull out a wide drill
with a hoe, or other tool, to the depth of about 3in. or 4in.,
and spread out the roots all round. Carefully shake the
soil in amongst the roots, and, if dry, apply some water
through a coarse-rosed watering pot, to settle the earth
around them. At intervals, as necessary, give other waterings
till September, when they should be discontinued.
At all times, keep the beds free from weeds, removing
them by the hand to prevent injury to the crowns of
the plants. If the ground is good, no liquid manure will
be needed the first year. As soon as the foliage turns
yellow, cut it off, cleanly rake over the beds, and leave till
about January, when a top-dressing of from 1in. to 3in. of
thoroughly rotted manure may be applied with advantage.
At the end of February, rake off the bed all loose straw or
other <em>debris</em>, and throw on them a little of the soil from
the alleys, raking down, and finishing off the edges squarely
and neatly. During this and succeeding years, apply
liquid manure and clear water, from time to time, as
required; and, provided the manure is not of too great
strength, there is scarcely any limit to its application; but,
in many instances, beds which have only received an annual
dressing have given a good return. Each year they must
be cut over and dressed as before described, but care must
be taken to keep them flat on the surface, otherwise the
plants will die out for want of moisture. When the produce
appears, the beds should be kept cut over until the
20th of June, after which, cutting should cease, or they will
be rendered comparatively unproductive. Cutting can
commence the second or third year, or as soon as there is
any "grass" worth taking. Several methods of growing
these plants could be cited, but that which we have recommended
will be found most satisfactory.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Seeds.</em> Plants are raised by sowing seeds in rows across
the kitchen garden, or selected quarter, about the month of
April. The seedlings make a growth, and form good plants
during the first season. In March or April of the following
year, or the year after, they may be removed, and planted
out permanently, as already alluded to. Many cultivators
prefer growing their own plants from seed; because during
the transit of the roots from any distance to where they are
to be grown, a frequent and injurious exhaustion takes
place, and particularly so when they are carelessly packed.</p>

<p><em>Forcing.</em> Asparagus can, if properly treated, be obtained
from December onwards; and at Christmas time the
produce is very valuable; but, in order to obtain it
at this season, it will be necessary to resort to forcing.
Prepare some beds to secure a lasting heat, and on these
place about 3in. of ordinary garden soil, not very stiff. Then
take the roots, and place them crown upwards, and moderately
close together, shaking the soil well amongst the
roots, and covering about a couple of inches deep. Water
well, to settle the whole, and put on the lights, allowing a
little ventilation, to let out any steam which may arise.
Unless the weather be very cold indeed, give a little air at
all times, and only cover the lights in actual frost. From
time to time, apply fresh linings of hot manure, and in cold
rains, or wind, cover the outsides of the frames with old sacks,
or other things which will keep in the heat. A regular and
steady temperature of 60deg. will force this plant with
better results than a higher one. Houses that are fitted with
hot-water pipes to give bottom heat can be used equally as
well as manure beds, and so long as the soil is
kept moist, the heat thus obtained is as good
as any for the purpose, and much less trouble
than fermenting materials. To keep up a
regular supply, a succession of beds will be
necessary. Asparagus can be forced, or rather
forwarded, in pots or boxes, in a warm greenhouse
or vinery, and, of course, when the plants
are done with, they can be cast away. We
give an illustration (Fig. 160) of a bearing
crown fit for gentle forcing; but, of course, it
must not be left so bare of earth as appears
here, which is done for the purpose of clearness.</p>

<p><em>Varieties.</em> Connover's Colossal, and Giant,
are the most esteemed. Strains are frequently
largely advertised as improvements on the
sorts above-mentioned, and the charges are
higher accordingly. The difference may be
generally attributed to the culture the plants
receive more than to an improved variety.
When saving seed for home sowing, they
should be taken from the strongest growths,
or deterioration will ensue.</p>

<p><a name="ASPARAGUS_BEETLE" id="ASPARAGUS_BEETLE"></a><strong>ASPARAGUS BEETLE</strong> (<em>Crioceris asparagi</em>), or
"Cross-bearer." This beautiful little insect is blue-black
or greenish; the thorax is red with two black
spots, and the wing-cases are yellow, with a black cross
on them; the legs and antenn√¶ are black. The short grey
larva is flat underneath, arched on the back, and covered
with hairs. The sides are of an olive hue, and the little
legs and head are black. It ejects a drop of blackish
fluid from the mouth when touched. When full grown,
which takes about a fortnight, the larva measures about
two lines in length; the average length of the perfect
Beetle is about three lines. Although this insect does
not actually destroy the plants, it inflicts much damage
on the foliage, and checks the growth of the stems after
they have attained some size, in consequence of which
the foliage becomes much less in the next season. The
eggs are fixed to the shoots, and are small, dark, pointed
bodies. The larv√¶ do the harm, as they feed on the
bark and tender portions of the plants. The mature
Beetles should be picked off by hand, and, by commencing
early enough in the season, their numbers will be greatly
reduced. Syringing the plants with water, heated to a
temperature that will not injure the plants, is found a
useful method for removing the grubs.</p>

<p><em>White Hellebore.</em> Freshly-ground White Hellebore,
sprinkled over the foliage while it is damp, and repeating
the operation at intervals of about eight days for
a season, will generally effect a riddance; but the following
will usually be found better in such cases. Neither
must be applied until after cutting ceases, as they are
very poisonous.</p>

<p><em>Paris Green.</em> This, mixed and used as for Cherry Fly
(<em>see</em> <a href="#BLACK_FLY"><strong>Black Fly</strong></a>), will generally got rid of the Beetle, if
applied about thrice each season for two years. It should,
however, only be used in severe cases.</p>

<p><em>Soot</em>, applied in the same manner as White Hellebore,
and in liberal quantities, will, in a season or two, clear
the beds. If a bushel of salt be mixed with each twenty
bushels of soot, it will enhance the effect.</p>

<p><strong>ASPARAGUS KNIFE.</strong> The Asparagus Knife consists

both sides, straight, with a sharp tip, and not unlike a
small chisel. Another had its blade slightly hooked, and
serrated at one end. But the best is that now almost
universally employed, and which is illustrated by Fig. 162.</p>

<p><a name="ASPERULA" id="ASPERULA"></a><strong>ASPERULA</strong> (from <em>asper</em>, rough; in allusion to the
leaves). Woodruff. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Rubiace√¶</em>. Hardy herbs, rarely
small shrubs. Flowers terminal and axillary, in fascicles.
Leaves opposite, with one, two, or three stipulas
on each side; they are therefore called four to eight in a
whorl, but between the uppermost leaves there are no
stipulas. Stems and branches usually tetragonal. Most
of the species are very pretty when in flower, and are,
therefore, well adapted for borders, rockwork, and shady
places, in almost any garden soil. Propagated by divisions
of the roots during spring and early summer. Herbaceous
perennials, except where otherwise stated.</p>

<p><a name="ASPHALT" id="ASPHALT"></a><strong>ASPHALT.</strong> Artificial Asphalt is now generally used
in England for footpaths, &amp;c. The recipes are various, one
of the best being the following: Lime rubbish two parts, coal
ashes one part (both must be very dry), sifted very fine;
mix them, and leave a hole in the middle of the heap,
wherein pour boiling hot coal tar; mix well together.
When as stiff as mortar, lay it down, 3in. thick, on a dry
and previously well-levelled surface. A boy should follow
with dry, finely-sifted sand, distributing just enough to
prevent his boots sticking to the tar. Two men should be
employed for the tarring, whilst another should attend to
the boiling operation. Only just enough tar to last ten
minutes must be taken from the furnace at one time,
as, if it be not boiling, the walks will become soft under
the action of very hot sun. This may be repeated every
three years. It is imperative that the surface, lime, coal
ashes and sand be perfectly dry, and that the days selected
for the operation be very fine, the hotter the better.
Another excellent plan is that of using gas lime and
coal ashes. There must be a firm foundation and smooth
surface. Spread the gas lime to about 1¬Ωin. deep, and level
with the back of a spade. Over this place a thin layer of
coal dust, and well roll. The work is then complete.</p>

Filix-f≈ìmina</em>. This handsome deciduous species has a great
number of varieties, the most important of which are described
below:</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. acrocladon</strong> (summit-branched).* <em>fronds</em> 9in. to 15in. long,
slender, bi- or tripinnate, the lower part very narrow, with the
apices of the pinn√¶ sometimes crested; upper portion of the
frond freely branched, divisions narrow and crested, the whole
forming a broad head.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. acuminatum</strong> (taper-pointed).* <em>fronds</em> 9in. to 12in. long,
lanceolate-acuminate in outline, with closely set pinn√¶, which
are similarly characterised, and particularly tapering at the
apices.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. apiculatum</strong> (apiculate).* <em>fronds</em> 6in. to 15in. long, 2in.
to 4in. broad, lanceolate-acuminate in outline, with variously
furcate apices; pinn√¶ closely set with distinctly acuminated
apices, and small roundish obtuse serrated pinnules.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. Applebyanum</strong> (Appleby's).* <em>fronds</em> narrow, 12in. to 24in.
long, with short blunt pinn√¶, while the extremities are dilated
into a broad furcated crest, which is very striking upon such a
narrow frond.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. Barnesii</strong> (Barnes's).* <em>fronds</em> 9in. to 15in. long, 3in. to 4in.
wide, lanceolate in outline, abrupt at the top, bipinnate; pinn√¶
alternate, closely set, lanceolate, acutely pointed, with densely
set, narrow, acutely serrate pinnules, with a very membranous
texture.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. calothrix</strong> (beautiful-hair).* <em>fronds</em> 9in. to 15in. long,
copiously divided into exquisitely fine segments, so that the fronds
present a very light and delicate appearance.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. contortum</strong> (contorted).* <em>fronds</em> very diversified, the
various pinn√¶ occasionally combining the characters of the
varieties <em>Applebyanum</em> and <em>Victori√¶</em>.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. coronatum</strong> (coronate).* <em>fronds</em> 6in. to 12in. long, 2in.
wide; pinn√¶ distinctly forked, sometimes slightly crested at the
apices; the upper extremity of the frond copiously forked, and by
the ramification of the divisions a broad crest is formed, about
3in. to 4in. across.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. corymbiferum</strong> (corymbose).* <em>fronds</em> 12in. to 18in. long,
4in. to 7in. broad, lanceolate-acuminate in general outline; pinn√¶
closely set, usually forked and crested at the apices, while the
extremities of the fronds are dilated into broad crests, nearly or
quite as wide at the broadest portion of the frond.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. crispum</strong> (crispy or curled).* <em>fronds</em> 6in. long, densely
set with very finely divided pinn√¶, which are thickly curled, presenting
a crispy appearance.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. dissectum</strong> (dissected).* <em>fronds</em> 6in. to 12in. long, ovate or
broadly lanceolate in form, with irregular and unequal pinn√¶;
the pinnules also differ very much, and are deeply cut, nearly
down to the rachises.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. Elworthii</strong> (Elworth's).* <em>fronds</em> 12in. to 20in. long, lanceolate,
tripinnate, terminated with a very dense crest, from
4in. to 6in. across; pinn√¶ and frequently the pinnules also more
or less forked and crested.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. Fieldi√¶</strong> (Field's).* <em>fronds</em> 12in. to 20in. long, narrow,
with regular or variously-forked divided pinn√¶, sometimes arranged
crosswise, with a very graceful disposition.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. Friselli√¶</strong> (Frisell's).* <em>fronds</em> pendent, sometimes 2ft.
long, rarely exceeding 1in. wide, bi- or tripinnate; pinn√¶ alternate,
imbricated, flabellate, with the margins of the pinnules or ultimate
divisions dentated.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. grandiceps</strong> (large-crested).* <em>fronds</em> 9in. to 15in. long,
lanceolate in outline, copiously forked both at the extremities
of the pinn√¶ and frond. The latter is furnished with a very
large globose crest, which causes the frond to present a beautifully
arched appearance.</p>

<p><strong>A. F-f. Grant√¶</strong> (Grant's).* <em>fronds</em> 9in. to 12in. long, lanceolate,
or broadly so, very thickly set with pinn√¶, copiously divided, with
the apices of the latter turned up, so that the plant has a crisp
or bristly appearance.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. Jonesii</strong> (Jones's).* <em>fronds</em> 12in. to 18in. long, oblong-lanceolate
in outline, slightly acuminate, bipinnate, furnished at
the extremities with a small crest; pinn√¶ alternate, copiously
forked and crested at the apices, even having larger crests than
the one at the upper extremity of the frond; pinnules narrow,
dentate, slightly crested.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. minimum</strong> (smallest).* <em>fronds</em> 4in. to 6in. long, 1in. wide,
lanceolate, bipinnate; pinnules densely set, imbricated, and
crispy.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. Moorei</strong> (Moore's).* <em>fronds</em> 4in. to 8in. long, linear, terminated
with a broad tasselled crest, 3in. or more in diameter;
pinn√¶ small, scattered, variously forked, crested, and slender.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. multifidum</strong> (many-fid).* A very vigorous growing
variety, producing fronds as large as those of the type, terminated
with large tasselled crests; pinn√¶ and pinnules narrow, the former
furnished with small crested apices. A variety known as <em>nanum</em>
much resembles the foregoing, but the crests are more dense, and
the fronds are usually not more than half the length.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. pannosum</strong> (pannose).* <em>fronds</em> 10in. to 20in. long, lanceolate
in outline, from 4in. to 6in. in the broadest part, bi- or (rarely)
tripinnate; pinn√¶ thickly set, closely alternated, lanceolate-acuminate
in form, with deep cut pinnules, and distinctly but
irregularly lobed; the whole frond is frequently tinged with
reddish-purple.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. plumosum</strong> (feathery).* <em>fronds</em> 12in. to 30in. long, 4in. to
10in. broad, broadly lanceolate in outline, tripinnate, beautifully
arched; pinn√¶ of the same form as the frond, copiously divided;
pinnules again divided into very fine segments. There are several
forms of this charming variety.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. Pritchardii</strong> (Pritchard's).* <em>fronds</em> 12in. to 30in. long,
very narrow, tapering especially towards the apices; pinn√¶
decussate, imbricate, rather irregular, with the margins of the
pinnules dentate. There is also a variety named <em>cristatum</em>, which
is finely crested at the apices of the pinn√¶, and is particularly
striking.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. ramosa</strong> (branched).* <em>fronds</em> 9in. to 12in. long, the lower
portion sparsely set with short irregular pinn√¶, sharply cut
into finely dentate pinnules; the upper part is divided into
two main branches, which are again variously forked, and furnished
with short pinn√¶, the ultimate divisions furcate and
slightly crested.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. scop√¶</strong> (heavily-crested).* <em>fronds</em> 6in. to 16in. long, with a
few scattered irregular pinn√¶ along the main rachis; some of the
pinn√¶ are almost obsolete, while others are an inch long with
oblong-dentate pinnules and a heavy terminal crest; the upper
portion has several ramifications, each of which is copiously forked
and heavily crested, the whole forming a corymbose head 3in. or
4in. in diameter, which gives the plant a pendent habit.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. sub-lunatum</strong> (half-crescent-shaped).* <em>fronds</em> 9in. to 20in.
long, less than 1in. wide, with curious alternated, nearly crescent-shaped,
much contracted pinn√¶, sparingly divided, arching.</p>

<p><strong>A. F.-f. Victori√¶</strong> (Victoria's).* <em>fronds</em> long, lanceolate in outline,
with the apices crested, as well as those of the pinn√¶; the latter
are forked at the base, the divisions being divergent, and crossing
those of the neighbouring pinn√¶. A form named <em>gracilis</em> has
narrower fronds, is more compact, and cresting rather thicker.
There is also another form named <em>lineare</em>, having very small
heavily crested fronds, and an extremely elegant appearance.
The foregoing are the most important varieties, but a very comparative
few of the total number. Although forms of an essentially
hardy species, the greater number&mdash;and particularly the
rarer sorts&mdash;should have a winter protection; or, what is far more
preferable and satisfactory, they should be grown in the frame or
temperate fernery.</p>

Greenhouse evergreen shrubs
from the Cape of Good Hope. Some
species of this genus, which is now
generally referred to <em>Helipterum</em>, are
very handsome, and thrive well in a
mixture of fibrous peat, leaf soil, and
sand, with thorough drainage. Fill
the pots one-third full of crocks; water carefully, and
only when absolutely necessary; and place in a situation
near the glass, allowing a free admission of air. Seeds
should be sown in pots of light, open soil, and placed in a
gentle heat; half-ripened cuttings will strike readily in
sandy soil with a hand glass placed over them. They are
now but rarely seen under cultivation.</p>

<p>The annuals (<em>Callistemma hortensis</em>), usually known as
French, German, or China Asters, are very extensively
grown, both for beds and pots, and their diversity and
generally compact growth render them almost universal
favourites. They require a rich loamy soil, and as the
roots are produced near the surface, a mulching of rotten
dung will be found most beneficial. Seeds may be raised
in a cold frame in March or April, and, when the
seedlings are large enough, they must be transplanted
into beds from 9in. to 12in. apart each way. If it
is desired to have them in pots, they may be removed
thence with a good ball of earth adhering just before they
commence flowering, liberally watered, and kept lightly
shaded from the sun, until root action is resumed. Those
kinds required for exhibition purposes should have several
of the side shoots removed, so that the whole growing
energy of the plant may be centralised into from five to
seven flower-heads, by which means fine blooms may be
obtained. The dwarf kinds are most valuable for bedding
and pots, as the taller kinds frequently require stakes for
support. The following are the most important sections:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>Betteridge's Prize.</strong> Very beautifully formed and brilliantly
coloured varieties, unsurpassed for exhibition purposes. As this
class has rather a straggling habit of growth, it is less suitable for
bedding and borders than many of the others.</p>

<p><strong>Boltze's Miniature Bouquet Pyramidal.</strong> Dwarf and elegant,
in compact bouquets of six or eight; the truss of flower-heads
springs directly from the ground, having only a few leaves
at base. Colours very varied. <em>h.</em> 6in. to 8in.</p></blockquote>

or biternate leaves, allied to <em>Spir√¶a</em>, from which they differ
in having not more than three carpels, eight or ten stamens,
and numerous albuminous seeds. They are all more or less
graceful, and some indispensable, either when grown in
isolated clumps, or intermingled with other herbaceous
plants. They thrive well in almost any rich garden soil,
preferring damp positions, and are easily propagated by
division, which is best done in early spring. <em>A. japonica</em>
is grown very extensively for decorative purposes, its elegant
spikes of pure white flowers rendering it especially
valuable. The majority of the plants cultivated are imported,
but they may be grown fairly well in this country
in heavily manured soil. They should be potted as early
as possible in the autumn, and plunged in ashes or fibre
outside, when they will soon commence to root, after which
they may be placed in heat, and forced as required, always
giving an abundance of water. Indeed, the pots may be
stood in pans of water, especially when the plants are well
furnished with growth.</p>

<p><a name="ASTRAGALUS" id="ASTRAGALUS"></a><strong>ASTRAGALUS</strong> (a name applied to a shrub by Greek
writers). Milk Vetch. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Leguminos√¶</em>. A very large
genus of hardy herbs or sub-shrubs. Flowers in axillary
clusters; standard larger than the wings. Leaves unequally
pinnate. About one hundred species have from time to
time been introduced in English gardens; many of these
are lost to cultivation; the comparative few here described
are still generally grown, and are good representative species.
They are all of easy culture. The shrubby kinds grow well
in any light dry soil, and are slowly increased by cuttings
placed in a cold frame, or by seeds. The herbaceous
perennials prefer a dry light soil, and may be increased by
divisions or seeds; the latter mode is preferable, as many
species are very liable to die if transplanted or divided,
which is at best but a slow method. Seed should be sown
in pots of sandy soil placed in a cold frame as soon as ripe,
or very early in the spring, as they may lie a long time
before germinating. The dwarfer species constitute admirable
rockwork plants, and can be grown in pots containing
a mixture of loam, peat, and sand. Seeds of the
two annual species, <em>A. Cicer</em> and <em>A. Glaux</em>, merely require
to be sown in the open border early in spring.</p>

<p><a name="AUBERGINE" id="AUBERGINE"></a><strong>AUBERGINE</strong>, or <strong>EGG PLANT</strong> (<em>Solanum melongena</em>,
variety <em>ovigerum</em>). These plants, besides being useful
for culinary purposes, are very ornamental, and present
an attractive appearance on walls or trellises, or in the
flower garden; and, as they do well in any ordinary rich
garden soil, if the position is warm, they give a good
variation to the general run of plants used for decorative
effects. The Black-fruited kind is particularly suited for
this purpose. Sow the seeds in a gentle heat, in the
middle of April. As soon as the seedlings are large enough
to handle, prick off into 4in. pots, replacing in heat till they
root out freely. Gradually harden off by June, and then
transfer to the positions where they are to grow. Let
the plants be at least 2ft. apart, and place a strong stick to
each one to support the fruit when it comes. For trellises,
select the more moderate-sized varieties. In hot, dry
weather, the application of liberal supplies of liquid manure
tends to increase the size of the fruit, and also to make the
foliage more vigorous and handsome. Where very large
fruit are needed for show or other purposes, it is well to
remove all but the best one on the plant, and, by careful
feeding with liquid manure, specimens of from 10lb. to 12lb.
weight can be had. The foliage should not be pinched, as
this would prevent the free swelling of the fruit. Aubergines
are not so much grown in England for culinary
purposes as in France and Italy, where they are largely
used in stews and soups. The following are the most
desirable varieties: New York Purple, the largest kind
grown, and although not as ornamental as the next, is quite
as useful; Black-fruited, large black fruit, with blackish
violet leaves; and White-fruited, the sort most generally
cultivated. See Figs. 191 and 192.</p>

<p><a name="AUBRIETIA" id="AUBRIETIA"></a><strong>AUBRIETIA</strong> (named after M. Aubriet, a famous
French botanical draughtsman). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Crucifer√¶</em>. A small
genus of hardy evergreen trailers. Racemes opposite the
leaves, and terminal, lax, few-flowered. Leaves ovate or
oblong, entire or angularly toothed, hairy. They make
excellent rock plants, and will thrive in a deep rich
loam anywhere, excepting under the shelter of trees.
Cuttings struck, or seeds sown, during April or May
generally make fine, dense, cushion-like growths, if transplanted
on to a somewhat cool or shaded border, and carefully
lifted in the autumn; the cuttings are best "drawn,"
or grown until they are soft, in a frame before they are
removed. Where a stock of old plants exist, layer the long
slender branches any time after flowering, and cover with
a mixture of sand and leaf soil; they will then root freely
and establish themselves in time for spring blooming, for
which purpose, when grown <em>en masse</em>, they are most useful.
After flowering, they may be divided and transplanted.</p>

<p><a name="AUCUBA" id="AUCUBA"></a><strong>AUCUBA</strong> (the Japanese name of the shrub). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>.
<em>Cornace√¶</em>. A genus of hardy evergreen shrubs, thriving
better than any other in the smoky atmosphere of dense
cities. They grow in ordinary well-drained garden soil, and
require no special culture. If grown in pots, they should be
planted firmly in rather sandy yellow loam, with plenty of
drainage. They should not be allowed too large pots, or
an unfruitful growth is likely to result. During the growing
season, an abundance of water is needed, which must be
lessened when the plants are fully developed. If cultivated
in the greenhouse or conservatory, they should be plunged
out of doors during summer. To insure a good supply of
the very ornamental berries, which are produced on the
female plant, careful fertilising is necessary. The time
for applying the pollen is when the pistil exudes a slightly
gummy substance, and otherwise shows signs of maturity.
When it happens, as is sometimes the case, that the male
blooms are open and the pollen mature before the female
blooms are ready, the pollen should be collected on a dry
camel-hair pencil, transferred to a piece of glass, and
covered over by another piece, both of which must also be
dry. It may be applied afterwards when wanted, as it
retains its power for some weeks. Propagated by cuttings,
inserted in any light sandy soil, with or without a
covering, in spring or autumn; or readily increased from
seeds, sown as soon as ripe.</p>

necessary to grow it successfully.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Frames</em> for the reception of Auriculas should be prepared,
with a good bottom drainage, and an inside staging, similar
to the back stage of a lean-to greenhouse, arranged as
near the glass as possible. If the frames are about 4ft.
wide, they will be very convenient; 1ft. deep in the
front, and about 3ft. at the back. This will allow for a
good stage arrangement. Of course, it is not necessary
to construct an expensive staging, as common boards can
be laid upon pots of various heights, the same results
being practically secured. These frames should face north
from May to October, and south in winter, during which
latter time it will be necessary to well cover the sides
with straw or brake. When frosty, the lights must also be
mated; but, unless there is absolute fear of frost, the glass
should not be covered, as the more light the plants receive
the better. On all suitable occasions, both during summer
and winter, air must be freely admitted, and a good look-out
kept during showery weather; hence it may be necessary
to tilt the lights with blocks rather than remove them
entirely. The latter plan should be adopted whenever
practicable, especially during early spring, and after they
are well established in their fresh pots in summer. This
will greatly assist to ripen the crown, and produce hard,
stout foliage, which will endure the winter much better
than if grown with less air. Many cultivators prefer small
span or lean-to houses to frames; and it must be admitted
that these are better, more convenient, and in every way
more beneficial. Simple, inexpensive structures, no higher
than is absolutely necessary for convenience, with top and
side ventilation, will meet all requirements; and if a 2in.
hot-water pipe is arranged next the eaves inside, it will be
a decided advantage during very severe weather.</p>

<p><em>Soil.</em> The best compost that can be prepared for Auriculas
is as follows: Four parts good fibrous loam, one part well-rotted
cow manure, one part good leaf soil, and one part
coarse river or silver sand, with a little charcoal or pounded
oyster-shells added. Carefully mix the whole together
before using. The loam should be stored about twelve
months previous to being used, and it should be selected
from districts with a fine atmosphere; the turf should be
cut about 3in. thick. Cow manure that has lain for a year
or so, and been subjected to sharp frosts, is most suitable,
as insect life, which it very probably contains, is thereby
destroyed, and the whole materially sweetened.</p>

<p><em>Potting.</em> This operation requires to be carefully done as
soon after flowering as possible, unless it is desired to save
seed, when it must be deferred until the seed is ripened.
May and June are the best months for general potting, and
whatever the size of the pots used, they should be carefully
and thoroughly drained. After a good layer of potsherds,
place some charcoal, leaf mould, or spent hops.
Many good growers use the last very advantageously. For
good flowering plants, 48-sized pots are used, many cultivators
preferring glazed pots to the unglazed; but such
are not absolutely necessary to ensure success. Before
repotting, remove most of the old soil, and with a sharp
knife cut off any bruised or cankered portion of roots;
the stout tap-root may also be cut away if devoid of
fresh rootlets. Do not pot very firmly. Remove the plants
to their summer quarters, withholding water for a few
days, and keep the frames close. About a week after
potting, water may be advantageously given, the plants will
then soon resume root-action, and air may be admitted
afterwards on all suitable occasions. The collar or neck of
the plant must be left well above the surface of the soil.</p>

<p><em>Watering</em> is a point that requires careful attention, as
neglect in this matter will result in failure. During the
growing season, Auriculas require an abundance of water;
in fact, they must never be allowed to get dry. In the
winter, they must only be watered when they are really
dry, especially during a severe season. Care must be taken
to avoid watering the leaves, particularly in early spring,
as this tends to spoil the effect of the charming farinose
foliage. Above all, water must not be allowed to stand in
the heart of the plant, as such will inevitably cause incipient
decay. Hence it is necessary to keep a sharp lookout
for drippings from the glass, and to maintain tightly-glazed
frames. On all occasions, decaying leaves must be
removed, and especially during winter.</p>

<p><em>Top-dressing.</em> About the middle or end of February, when
the plants commence new growth, the surface soil should
be removed about an inch or so deep, and the pots re-filled
with a rich compost made up of the following: Two parts of
turfy loam, one of rotten cow or hen manure, and one of
leaf soil; if a little Standen's Manure is added, the compost
will be improved. After this top-dressing, the plants may
be watered freely.</p>

<p><em>Propagation by Offsets.</em> When top-dressing, any offsets
with roots should be removed, and as soon after as possible
the remaining ones should be taken off, as it is much more
desirable to do so early than later on, when repotting;
for, when making the first growth, they are the more
likely to root better, and stand a greater chance of
making good plants before the season is over. Fill well-drained
3in. pots with sandy soil, and arrange about four
offsets round the sides; place under a bell glass, or in a
close handlight, watering very sparingly so as to prevent
them damping off. They will soon establish themselves,
after which air may be admitted, and the plants may ultimately
be potted off singly. To induce choice varieties to
make offsets, the top of the old plant should be removed
and treated like the others, when, as a rule, several shoots
will be produced, which in due time may be removed. By
this means, a nice stock of the rarer kinds may be obtained;
whereas, if such a course were not adopted, the rate of
increase would be extremely slow.</p>

<p><em>Flowering.</em> During the flowering period, watering, as
already stated, must be carefully attended to, for if the
plants are allowed to get dry, the flowers will quickly
shrivel. They must also be kept well shaded from sunshine,
which quickly destroys the delicate blossoms. As the
trusses are developing, particular attention must be given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to night protection. It is, perhaps, better to cover every
night than to run the risk of exposing the unexpanded
flowers to frost, as the effect is very prejudicial; in fact,
if subject to frost, smooth even flowers may not be expected.</p>

<p><em>Seed Saving and Sowing.</em> The only way to obtain new
varieties is by seed; hence the value of careful seed-saving
will be apparent. Severe discrimination must be
exercised in the selection of parents, and the flowers must
be very carefully crossed. The anthers should be removed
from the pistillate parent, if possible, before expansion, so
as to prevent any possibility of self-fertilisation; and, when
the stigma is ready, the pollen must be conveyed by means
of a small camel's-hair brush, care being taken not to mistake
the brushes used in different classes. It has been observed
in Auriculas that the issue from crossbred seed favours
the pollen more than the pistillate parent; hence the necessity
of selecting good pollen parents. It is best to confine
hybridisation to separate classes&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, cross a Self with a
Self, and a Green-edged variety with another of the same
class. The importance of selecting the best in each class
scarcely needs suggestion, having regard to constitution as
well as the quality of the flowers. The seed should be sown
as soon as ripe, or early in March, in well-drained pots, filled
with sandy soil, which must be well watered previous to
sowing. When this operation is completed, the seed must
be lightly covered with coarse sand, a sheet of glass placed
over the pot, and the latter stood in the hand glass, where
the offsets are rooted. Some of the seedlings will appear
in a month, but the bulk from that sown when ripe will not
be seen until the following spring; while others will germinate
even during the ensuing summer. The late comers
should be particularly cared for, as they frequently produce
the best varieties. When the seedlings are large
enough, they must be pricked off in pots of sandy soil; and,
when well established, potted off singly into small thumb
pots, and afterwards encouraged as judgment suggests.
Some growers allow the seedlings to remain in the store
pots till they flower, when the best are kept, and those not
required disposed of.</p>

<p><em>Insect Pests.</em> Green fly are often very troublesome, and
should be exterminated as speedily as possible, by tobacco
fumigation, or by dipping the plants in a solution of
Gishurst's Compound, or carefully prepared Fir-tree Oil,
all of which are effectual. Many authorities denounce
fumigation, while others advocate it. The roots are also
attacked by a mealy louse, named <em>Trama auricul√¶</em>, which
clusters about the roots and collar of the plants, sucking
nutriment therefrom; and although, provided they do
not attack the collar, they have no greatly prejudicial
effect on the plant, yet it is desirable to exterminate
them. The only effectual way of accomplishing this is
to remove all soil, and thoroughly cleanse the roots
and collar in a solution of soft soap, with a little Fir-tree
Oil added. Of course, this is most easily managed when
repotting; and, unless the plants are very badly infested, it
would not be advisable to run the risk of root washing
later in the year.</p>

<p><em>Classes.</em> Auriculas are now arranged in five classes, four
of which constitute what are known as "show or stage
Auriculas," while the other is known by the name of
"Alpines." Each class is characterised by special points
of distinction, which, in the opinion of the strict "florists"
school, it is of the utmost importance to observe; and as
there is room for systematists in this, as well as in any
other branch of floriculture, we will follow the arrangement
usually adopted, and describe the distinguishing features
of, and enumerate some of the best varieties in, each class,
with their raisers' names attached:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>Green-edged.</strong> Outer edge green, or but sparingly dusted with
powder; next, a zone of colour known as the body colour, which
varies, the darkest being most esteemed; both edges of this zone
should be even, especially the inner one, but there are few
flowers perfect in this respect. Next to the body-colour is the
paste, which occupies the space between the inner circle of the
latter and the throat, this should be pure and dense, with a distinctly
circular outline at the throat; the throat and tube should
be bright yellow. Of course, this ideal standard has not yet been
reached, as there are supposed defects in all or some sections
of the flowers at present known. <em>Leading Varieties</em>: A<span class="smcapa">DMIRAL</span>

neither be tortuous nor of a "tedious sameness," but a
gradually winding line should, above all, be obtained, which
must in no way interfere with the view from the house.
About 12ft. is the width usually allowed for the road, but
this depends upon individual taste or idea&mdash;this remark
applies to planting in double rows, the trees forming a
series of triangles, or in single rows. The distance across
the road from one row of trees to those opposite should be
at least 24ft. The Lime is extensively used for Avenues
on account of its regular growth and the shade it affords.
The Cedar of Lebanon is one of the best and most suitable
evergreens. The Dutch Elm is used because of its rapid
growth, and forms one of the best deciduous trees for this
purpose. The well-known Horse Chestnut, in sheltered
spots, is very ornamental, as is also the Spanish Chestnut;
the latter spreads rapidly. Where immediate effect is
required, nothing gives more satisfaction than the White
Poplar; it grows in a wet soil better than anything else.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Deodars, Araucarias, Douglas Pine, the Mexican, Chinese,
and Japanese Cypresses, and many others, are eminently
suited for Avenue planting. Shrubs and herbaceous plants
should be introduced between the trees, and so remove any
bareness that may occur. <em>Diervilla rosea</em>, and its variegated
form, <em>Aucubas</em>, <em>Rhododendrons</em>, <em>Hypericums</em>, and
many others, could be mentioned to serve this purpose.
A moderately good soil will be found to answer generally.</p>

popular hardy deciduous shrubs. When plants are grown
in the open, artificial crossing will be unnecessary; but this
method must be employed upon those grown in the cool
greenhouse, if well fertilised seeds are required. The seed
should be gathered and sown when ripe in a large shallow
frame containing from 2in. to 3in. of peat, over which more
peat must be laid very level by means of a fine sieve;
or they may be kept until early the following spring. No
covering will be necessary, but a thorough watering with
a fine-rosed water-pot must be given. The lights should
be darkened, and the frames kept close until the young
seedlings begin to appear, when they must have air (carefully
admitted), shade, and a daily sprinkling of water. By
the autumn, they will be large enough to transplant in
small clumps into boxes of peat and coarse sand, and to
place in other frames, or in the open. In each case, they
will need watering, shading, and to be kept close until
growth commences. The hardier the plants are before
winter commences, the better; but a protection of mats or
similar material will prevent the probability of their being
killed by severe frosts. During the following season, they
will only require water during dry weather, and no protection
need be afforded this winter. The next spring, they
should be planted out singly in beds, sufficiently wide apart
to allow the development of two years growth. If an
upright growth is being made, the leading shoot must be
shortened, in order to secure dwarf, well-branched plants.
The same methods should be employed on a smaller scale
where but a few are wanted. Grafting is largely practised
to increase the stock of named varieties or choice
seedlings, the stock employed being <em>A. pontica</em>. This
process, of course, ensures the quicker production of flowering
plants. Layering in March, encasing the part buried
with moss, is also some times practised; but the layer
must be left two years before separating. Cuttings of the
last year's wood, 2in. or 3in. long, taken with a heel,
root readily in sand; about the end of August is the best
time for so doing. If they are pricked off in pots or
pans of sandy soil, and kept in a cool frame until they
are calloused, and afterwards introduced into a slight
bottom heat, they root quicker, but this is not absolutely
essential. When placed outside, they should be covered
with a handlight for about two months, and, at the end
of this time, air should be gradually given and increased.
Ghent Azaleas are now forced extensively for the market
as well as in private gardens; and, by judicious culture,
they can be had in full blossom by Christmas. With this
end in view, they should be grown in pots, and have the
growth prematurely completed soon after flowering with
the aid of a little artificial heat; after which they may
be placed outside. During very hot and dry weather, the
north side of a wall is necessary, to prevent their flowering
in the autumn. The same plants must only be forced
every alternate year. Commence to place the plants in
heat in October, and keep up a succession until the
following March. The best plants for forcing purposes
are obtained from the Continent, where they are grown
in enormous quantities. When grown permanently out
of doors, the most suitable soil is peat and rough sand
mixed. Failing this, leaf mould, maiden loam, and sand,
will be found satisfactory. In many cases, we have known
them to flourish in ordinary garden soil.</p>

<p><em>Indian or Chinese Azaleas.</em> This is a section of greenhouse
evergreen varieties obtained from <a href="#A_INDICA"><em>A. indica</em></a> (which
<em>see</em>), blooming continuously from November to June, or
even later, and of the greatest value for all purposes,
whether for decoration, cutting, or exhibition. Cultivation:
Thorough drainage is essential, and a compost of
half peat, the other half made up of fibrous loam, leaf
soil, and sand, in equal quantities. They cannot have
too much light and air, and may be grown to almost
any size by shifting from one pot to a size larger. In
repotting, the whole of the crocks should be taken away
from the base of the ball of soil and roots, and the top
should also be removed till the fine roots are reached.
The plant should then be put in the new pot, and the
additional soil rammed firm, in order to prevent the water
running through it, and thus depriving the plant of any
benefit therefrom. In all cases, the roots near the stem
must be above the soil, so that the water may not sink in
next the stem, or death will most certainly ensue. After
potting, for a few days the plants should be kept close and
freely syringed, and as the growth is completed, they
may be well hardened off. The best time for potting
is after flowering, before the new growth has been made.
From October to June the plants should be in the greenhouse,
and during the other months in a cold frame, or
plunged in pots in the open; or, what is preferable in
favoured localities, planted out in prepared beds; they will
thus be kept cleaner, and the growth will be much
superior. In autumn they may be lifted and repotted,
placing in a shady position for a few days. Water in
abundance must be given throughout the blooming and
growing season; and the plants must, on no account, be
allowed to become dry. At the same time, a proper amount
of care is most essential, as an excessive amount of
moisture is equally as fatal as drought. Cuttings should
be placed in sand under a bell glass with moderate bottom
heat; half-ripened ones are preferable. They must be
cut up to a joint&mdash;the base of a leaf&mdash;the lower leaves
for an inch stripped off, and the stem stuck into the
sand, which should lay, about an inch thick, on the top of
sandy peat soil; the bottom of the cuttings should reach,
but not go quite into, the soil. The whole should be
covered with a bell glass, which must be wiped dry
every morning. Soon after the cuttings have commenced
growing, place them in small pots. They are also very
largely and easily increased by grafting; indeed, this is the
only satisfactory method of securing standards. Seeds
may be sown similar to the last section, but in the
greenhouse, and, when well up, pricked out into little
pots 1in. apart. Azaleas are liable to the attacks of
thrips and red spider, the latter being especially troublesome
if the plants are in a dry position; frequent
syringing will materially help to eradicate both pests.
If insufficient, syringe with a solution of Gishurst's Compound.</p>

<p><a name="BABIANA" id="BABIANA"></a><strong>BABIANA</strong> (from <em>babianer</em>, the Dutch for baboon; in
reference to the bulbs being eaten by baboons). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>.
<em>Iridace√¶</em>. A genus of very ornamental bulbous plants
confined to the Cape of Good Hope, with the exception of a
single species, which is found in Socotra. Flowers occasionally
fragrant, and generally characterised by their rich
self-colours, or the striking contrast of very distinct hues in
the same flower; perianth regular and symmetrical, with six
ovate divisions (tube varying in length). Stems from 6in.
to 9in. high, arising from a small bulb-like corm, and bearing
tapering plaited leaves, which are usually more or less
densely covered with long hairs; the scapes are racemose,
each bearing about six or more simultaneously expanding
flowers. They may be successfully grown in pots. By this
plan there is, perhaps, less danger of loss, and their flowering
season can be prolonged considerably. A light sandy
compost, with a small proportion of well-decayed manure,
is required, and thorough drainage is also most essential.
Use 48 or 60-sized pots, placing four or five corms in the
former, and two or three in the latter, and keep moderately
dry until they commence to form roots. October is the
best time to pot. As soon as the plants appear above
ground, water may be carefully given, and the supply pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>portionately
increased as the plants develop. Very weak
liquid manure, applied twice a week, just as the spikes are
pushing up, will be beneficial. When the flowers fade,
and the stems show signs of decay, the supply of water
must be gradually decreased, thus inducing the thorough
maturation of the corms, upon which the next season's display
depends. When quite down, store the pots in a dry
place till the time for repotting arrives, when the corms
should be carefully cleaned, and all offsets separated, the
latter being potted up in the same way as the parent
corms in order to produce flowering specimens; or they may
be kept in a pot of sand and planted in a warm border outside
in March. Outdoor culture: A sheltered, sunny, and
well-drained situation is most essential to success. Although
not absolutely necessary, it is preferable to replant
every year in early spring, placing the bulbs about 5in. or
6in. deep, with a little sand sprinkled about them. Planting
may, of course, be done in autumn, when it will be
necessary to cover with cocoa nut fibre refuse to the depth
of 5in. or 6in. In warm, sheltered situations, the corms
may remain undisturbed; but, as a rule, it is desirable to
remove them late in autumn, when the leaves are dead, and
store them in dry sand through the winter in a cool, airy
position, free of frost. Mixed Babianas may be purchased
from dealers at a cheap rate, and, for general purposes,
they are best to plant. Propagation may be effected by
offsets and seeds. The former is the best and quickest
method. The offsets should be grown in boxes or planted
out in light rich soil until large enough for flowering.
Seeds sown in pans, and placed in a gentle heat, will grow
at almost any time; the young plants will require to be
carefully transplanted each season until they develop into
blooming corms.</p>

evergreen shrub, allied to <em>B√¶ckea</em>, from which it
differs in having the stamens collected in groups opposite

be planted in sand under a bell glass, and kept in a
moderate heat until rooted, when they should be placed
singly in small pots, in a compost of equal parts loam
and peat, with the addition of a little sand. As the
small pots fill with roots, the plants should be removed
into larger ones, and the compost have less sand in it;
but this should not be done until the next February. The
established plants must have a good shift about March
or April, and should be kept in a light, airy greenhouse;
the first shoots may be topped to moderate their vigour,
and to produce a greater profusion of less luxuriant ones.
In May, when most plants are removed from the greenhouse,
these should be set to grow under a frame which,
while shielding them from heavy rains, and supporting
some slight shading in the hottest parts of the sunny days,
will not prevent a free circulation of air. To this end, the
frame should be elevated from the rests or supports at its
corners; the lights should be left off at night in fine, mild
weather, and on dull, cloudy days, being only replaced
during heavy rains, and when shading is necessary. Towards
autumn, the plants must be returned to the greenhouse.</p>

various kinds are most serviceable, the best being Arbutus,
Aucubas, Boxes, Euonymuses, Hollies, Irish and Goldon
Yew, Portugal Laurel, Retinosporas, Vincas, &amp;c. These
may be grown in pots, and when replaced by the summer
occupants, should be plunged in some reserve quarter,
where they should receive plenty of water; by this means,
they will increase in size, and keep in a healthy condition.
Very little water will be required during the winter.

<p><a name="BALSAM" id="BALSAM"></a><strong>BALSAM</strong> (<em>Impatiens Balsamina</em>). A well-known
ornamental and tender annual, native of India. It is
one of the showiest of summer and autumn flowers, and
well deserves a place in every garden. Although of comparatively
easy cultivation, good blooms and well-grown
plants are far too rarely seen. A good Balsam bloom should
be quite as double as a perfect Camellia, and to show to the
greatest advantage should appear like one in the arrangement
of the petals. To secure this, seeds should only be
saved from the finest and most perfect flowers, although
the quantity must, of necessity, be small. They should be
sown, about the third week in March, in properly prepared
pans of rich sandy soil, and placed in a gentle bottom heat
of about 65deg. As soon as the first rough leaf appears,
the plants should be potted off into 3in. pots, care being
taken to let the cotyledon, or seed leaves, be close to the
soil. When the roots touch the sides of the pots, the plants
should be moved into larger ones, and this should be repeated
until they are in 8in. or 10in. pots. Some growers
place one or two seeds in small pots, so as to avoid the
first shift, and a good plan it is. During the time the
plants are under glass, they should be kept as near the
light as possible, and be frequently turned around, so that
they do not draw to one side; and careful training must
be given to those that are required in fine form. Disbudding
is also necessary to such as are wanted at their
best, removing all bloom from the main stem and base of
branches until the plants are of sufficient size, and then
the buds at the tops will bloom almost simultaneously.
The buds that will be formed afterwards will cause a continuance
of blossom for a long time, in fact, for some
months, if the plants are liberally supplied with liquid
manure. If it is desired for them to flower out of doors,
the plants should be transferred, about May, to a frame
where the heat is not above 50deg., and be kept in a steady
growing state, air being admitted on all suitable occasions,
cold winds and heavy rains avoided, and water supplied
when needed; never allow them to get dry. They require
training and disbudding the same as those grown in the
greenhouse. About June, the plants should be fully exposed
during the day; and, when danger of frost is over,
the lights may be kept off altogether. These should bloom
at the end of July. In all cases, plenty of drainage must be
allowed, as the amount of water required is very great.
Insects must be sharply looked after, as well as slugs
and snails. There are several sections, such as Camellia-flowered
(see <a href="#FIG_TWO_HUNDRED_AND_ONE">Fig. 201</a>), Rose-flowered, &amp;c., each containing
variously striped, spotted, and entire coloured blooms, and
it is best to pay an extra figure to secure a good strain.</p>

<p><a name="BAMBUSA" id="BAMBUSA"></a><strong>BAMBUSA</strong> (from <em>bambu</em>, the Malay name).
Bamboo Cane. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Gramine√¶</em>. A genus of ornamental,
shrubby, greenhouse, half-hardy or hardy
shrubs, each culm flowering but once. Flowers
usually hexandrous. Leaves, as a rule, relatively shorter
than the stems, lanceolate, and narrowed at the base.
Stems jointed, flexuose, branching, usually hollow, and,
when mature, of a hard, woody nature. In well drained,
sheltered situations, in the open, with rich, loamy soil,
some of the species make extremely graceful objects, particularly
so in the more southern counties of England,
and in parts of Scotland. Unless a very severe winter
is experienced, they may be left without protection.
Plants of all the species, however, should have the shelter
of a cold greenhouse till about the end of April; when they
should be gradually hardened off, and transferred to a
warm, sheltered spot, such as in woodlands, by the margins
of lakes, &amp;c., as they like plenty of moisture during
the summer. A good watering must be given after planting,
to settle the soil. Propagation is effected by careful
division of well-developed plants, which should be done in
early spring, just as new growth is commencing; and it
is advisable to establish the divisions in pots. <em>See also</em>

<p><strong>BANKS.</strong> These are usually formed with a view to
increasing the amount of surface ground, and for the
acceleration or retarding of vegetable crops, such as strawberries,
&amp;c. They should be from 6ft. to 12ft. apart, according
to the depth of soil, and run from east to west.
In constructing Banks of a uniform size, great care, and
a constant use of the garden line, will be found necessary.
For the warmest side of the Banks, Dwarf French Beans,
Peas, Vegetable Marrows, Cucumbers, New Zealand Spinach,
Capsicums, &amp;c., may be grown. On the opposite side, and
when a prolonged supply is desired, Cauliflower, Broccoli,
Lettuce, Turnip, Spinach, &amp;c., may be sown thinly in drills,
to be thinned out, and remain. It needs but little discretion
to produce valuable crops by this method.</p>

<p><a name="BANKSIA" id="BANKSIA"></a><strong>BANKSIA</strong> (named in honour of Sir Joseph Banks,
once President of the Royal Society, and a distinguished
patron of science, particularly of Natural History). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>.
<em>Proteace√¶</em>. Greenhouse evergreen shrubs, natives of Australia,
principally grown for the beauty of their foliage.
Leaves variable in form, usually dark green, clothed with
white or rufous down beneath; margins deeply serrated or
spinous, rarely entire. The following is the mode of culture
recommended many years ago by Sweet. The pots
should be well drained, by placing a potsherd about half
way over the hole at the bottom of the pot, then laying
another piece against it that it may be hollow, afterwards
putting some smaller pieces all around them, and on the
top of these some others broken very small. All the
plants belonging to the order <em>Proteace√¶</em> should be drained
in a similar manner, as the roots are very fond of running
amongst the broken potsherds, and consequently there is
less danger of their being overwatered. Care must also be
taken not to allow them to flag, as they seldom recover if
once allowed to get very dry. The plants should be placed
in an airy part of the house when indoors. Cuttings are
generally supposed to be difficult to root, but this is not
the case if properly managed. Let them be well ripened
before they are taken off; then cut them at a joint, and
place them in pots of sand, without shortening any of the
leaves, except on the part that is planted in the sand, where
they should be taken off quite close. The less depth they
are planted in the pots the better, so long as they stand
firm when the sand is well closed round them. Place them
under hand glasses in the propagating house, but do not
plunge them in heat. Take the glasses off frequently to
give them air, and dry them, or they will probably damp
off. When rooted, transfer to small pots; after which,
place them in a close, unheated frame, and harden by
degrees. Seeds are a very unsatisfactory means of multiplying
the stock.</p>

but now referred by Bentham and Hooker to
<em>Amaryllidace√¶</em>. Very singular and pretty stove evergreen
herbaceous perennials, allied to <em>Vellozia</em>. Flowers
purple, large, showy; perianth funnel-shaped, resinosely
hairy on the outside; limb spreading; scapes one-flowered,
usually clothed with glandular hairs. Leaves firm, spiral,
spreading, acutely keeled. Lindley says that they are
capable of existing in a dry, hot air without contact with
the earth, on which account they are favourites in South
American gardens, where, with Orchids and Bromeliads,
they are suspended in the dwelling houses, or hung to
the balustrades of the balconies, in which situation they
flower abundantly, filling the air with their fragrance.
They are rarely seen in our gardens. They may be grown
in baskets of fibrous loam and peat, with some nodules of
charcoal added.</p>

deciduous, epiphytal, cool-house orchids, having slender
pseudo-bulbs, from 6in. to 12in. high, from the top of which
the numerous flower-stems are produced. In a cool, airy
temperature, these plants grow vigorously, suspended in
pans or small baskets close beneath the glass, and slightly
shaded with tiffany. They succeed well also on flat blocks
of wood, on the top of which they should be tied, without
any moss, as their freely-produced, thick, fleshy roots soon
cling to the blocks. During the season of growth, a good
supply of water is needed, and in hot weather it may be
applied three or four times daily; the blocks and plants
are best immersed in water; but when at rest, a slight
watering twice or three times a week will suffice. Propagated
by divisions, just previous to the commencement of
new growth.</p>

<p><strong>BARREN FLOWERS.</strong> The male or staminate
flowers of many plants, such as the Cucumber, Melon, &amp;c.,
are popularly known as Barren Flowers, <em>i.e.</em>, they produce
no fruit. This condition is, in some respects, similar
to "blind" Strawberries or "blind" Cabbages, so far as
fruition is concerned, but structurally and functionally it
is widely different. The Barren Flowers of the Cucumber,
Melon, &amp;c., are produced by what are known as mon≈ìcious
plants, <em>i.e.</em>, having male and female organs in different
flowers, but on the same plant. In the Strawberry, &amp;c.,
Barren Flowers are generally the result of unfavourable
surroundings, or unskilful cultivation. A good example of
Barren Flowers is seen in the ray-florets of many
Composite plants, which are frequently really
neuter, having neither male nor female organs.</p>

<p><strong>BARREN SOILS.</strong> A term signifying such
soils as are normally unprofitable. The term can
only be correctly applied in very few cases; as
almost any soil may be rendered capable of affording
a basis for some kind of vegetable life, arboreal
or other. The question of planting up the
enormous quantity of what is now waste land, might well
engage the most practical consideration. Of course, the
natural state of any land will, to a great extent, determine
what would be its ultimate condition, after all that could
be effected by mechanical agency has been accomplished.
Drainage, irrigation, enrichment, pulverisation, are all
matters which can only be considered upon a particular
basis; but we doubt not that the thousands of acres of
land now practically almost useless, might, by the adoption
of proper means, be rendered fairly remunerative.</p>

<p><a name="BARRINGTONIA" id="BARRINGTONIA"></a><strong>BARRINGTONIA</strong> (named after the Hon. Daines
Barrington, F.R.S.). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Myrtace√¶</em>. A genus of stove
evergreen trees and shrubs, very difficult to cultivate.
Flowers large, racemose. Leaves opposite or whorled,
generally obovate; margins toothed or entire. Fruit one-seeded,
fleshy. They require a compost of two parts loam,
one peat, and one sand. Water should be given in abundance,
and a moist atmosphere at all times maintained, the
temperature ranging from 65deg. to 95deg. Propagated
by cuttings obtained from the lateral shoots; these, taken
off at a joint when the wood is ripe, planted in sand, with
a hand glass over them, root readily. The cuttings should
not be stripped of any of their leaves.</p>

seldom attains a height of more than 6ft. or 8ft. (G. C. 1845, p. 56.)</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>BARROW.</strong> Garden Barrows are very numerous, both
with and without wheels. The Flower-pot Barrow has a
wheel and a flat surface, on which plants, pots, or leaves are
placed, either directly, or, when small, in shallow baskets.
The Haum Barrow is an open box or case, of wicker or
other work, placed on, or suspended from, a pair of handles,
with or without a wheel, and is useful for carrying litter,
leaves, &amp;c. The Water Barrow, instead of a box, contains
a barrel, tub, or cistern, in which fluid manure, or ordinary
water, is conveyed to different parts of the garden. The
Hand-barrow is a frame of wood, carried by two levers,
which form four handles; for removing large pots or tubs
of trees or shrubs it is very useful.</p>

Hardy annuals or biennials, downy, with stiff and
bearded hairs. This genus is now placed under <em>Mentzelia</em>
in most standard botanical works. Flowers white or yellow,
large, terminal, expanding in the evening, when they are very
fragrant, and becoming reddish as they fade. Leaves alternate,
interruptedly pinnatifid. The species are very showy,
and well worth growing. Any ordinary garden soil suits
them. Seeds should be raised in a gentle heat in spring;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and, when the seedlings are sufficiently large, they should
be potted singly into small, well-drained pots. In winter,
they should be placed on a dry shelf in a greenhouse or
frame. <em>B. aurea</em> is one of the brightest of hardy annuals,
and may be sown either in a frame, or in the open border
in April.</p>

<p><strong>BASELLACE√Ü.</strong> A series of usually herbaceous

<p><strong>BASIL, SWEET</strong> (<em>Ocymum basilicum</em>). This is a
tender annual from India, and must be raised in gentle
heat. The foliage is somewhat largely used for flavouring
purposes. Seeds should be sown in April, the seedlings
pricked out into boxes to strengthen, and finally planted
out about 8in. asunder, in beds of light rich soil, in June,
being well watered until fully established. As soon as they
bloom, they should be cut down to within a few inches of
the ground, and the portions cut off should be tied up in
small bunches and dried in the shade for winter use.
Some of the plants can be lifted in September, potted up,
and placed in a warm greenhouse for the winter, when
the fresh green leaves will be found very useful. Bush
Basil (<em>Ocymum minimum</em>) is a dwarfer plant, but may be
treated in the same way. Wild Basil is botanically known

<p><a name="BASKETS" id="BASKETS"></a><strong>BASKETS.</strong> Few objects contribute more to the adornment
of a window, or the decoration of the diningroom,
drawing-room, or glass-house, than Hanging Baskets, tastefully
filled with handsome foliaged and flowering plants.
Baskets are made in different forms and of various materials,
such as wire, terra-cotta, wood, and cork. The Wire Baskets
have a very light and elegant appearance, and are generally
used. In filling Baskets, the inside should be lined with a
thick layer of moss, or <em>Selaginella Kraussiana</em>, next to
which a layer of coarse sacking must be placed, to prevent
the soil from working through. Terra-cotta Baskets are
very pretty, and are extensively employed in domestic
rooms, but they should always have one or more holes at
the bottom, to facilitate drainage. Rustic Baskets, of cork
or wood, are also very suitable for floral arrangements;
those composed of teak-wood are very generally used for
orchids. The compost should be prepared according to the
requirements of the plant or plants intended to be grown,
which can be easily ascertained on reference to such plants
in this work. The soil should not be allowed to get dry;
in the event of this happening, however, a thorough soaking
by immersion must be given. As a rule, attention should
be given in the matter of watering every other day, and
light syringing every morning and evening during the
spring and summer months will be most beneficial. The
Baskets should be examined every week, all dead or decaying
leaves being removed, and any insects, which are so
likely to get a foothold, destroyed. In arranging the subjects,
the centre plant should be the tallest, the next outer
ones shorter, and the marginal ones of a trailing or drooping
habit, so that the whole may present a symmetrical, and at
the same time a natural, appearance. Wickerwork Baskets
are used for carrying or transferring plants, and are generally
made 18in. wide by 20in. deep; they are extremely useful,
and should be in every garden. Split wood and withes are
largely employed in making Baskets. The Planter's Basket,
described by Loudon as a flat, rectangular utensil of wickerwork
or boards, partitioned into three or more parts, for the
purpose of carrying with the gardener when about to plant
or remove plants, is now, unfortunately, almost obsolete.
One division is for the plants, another for those taken up,
and a third for the tools to be made use of, and for any
decayed parts of plants, stones, weeds, or other refuse which
may be collected. By using this Basket, order, accuracy,
and neatness are secured. The Sussex "Truck" Baskets,
made of willow-wood, are very useful, being both light and
durable. <em>See also</em> <strong>Measures</strong>.</p>

<p><a name="BASS" id="BASS"></a><strong>BASS</strong> or <strong>BAST MATS</strong>. These are prepared, chiefly
in Russia, from the inner bark of various Limes (<em>Tilia</em>), and
are very largely used in this country by nurserymen for
packing purposes. They are also extensively employed as
coverings, being excellent preventatives of the effects of
frost. They are beneficial as a covering for beds of early
vegetables, to prevent radiation during the night. For
tying purposes they are now greatly superseded by Raffia
Grass. Archangel Mats are larger, and of better quality
than the St. Petersburgh. Dunnage Mats are heavy, and
generally used for covering, as they are much cheaper.</p>

<p><a name="BEAN_BEETLE" id="BEAN_BEETLE"></a><strong>BEAN BEETLE</strong> (<em>Bruchus granarius</em>). This insect,
by depositing its eggs in the seeds of Beans and Peas,
causes a great amount of injury. It is about an eighth of
an inch long, black, with brown hairs and white spots; tip
of the tail prolonged, downy; front pair of legs reddish.
The most effectual means of prevention is to destroy,
when sowing, all seeds infested by it; and this may be
detected by the skin of the seed being unusually transparent
above the tunnel for exit. Imported seeds of
Broad Beans are often much infested. "Dipping the
Beans or Peas in boiling water for one minute is stated
to kill the grub inside; but, as dipping for four minutes
generally destroys the germinating power, the experiment
is much too hazardous for general use", (Ormerod).</p>

to secure good crops, must be deeply worked and heavily

not care for so heavy a soil as the Broad and Long-podded

their respective situations. The term Kidney is generally
applied to both the Dwarf or French and the Climbing

<p>B<span class="smcapa">ROAD</span> <span class="smcapa">AND</span> L<span class="smcapa">ONG</span>-<span class="smcapa">PODDED</span> (<em>Faba vulgaris</em>). <em>Cultivation</em>:
As early as possible in the autumn, deeply trench
a piece of ground, and work in a heavy dressing of manure,
leaving the surface of the soil in ridges, to become well
a√´rated by winter frosts. Where desired, a piece of
ground on a warm, protected border, can also be deeply
dug in November, and a few rows of Mazagans sown to
stand the winter. When up, draw a ridge of soil on
either side the rows, and in frosty weather strew a few
handfuls of bracken, or other light, dry litter, over them.
Not much is, however, gained by this winter sowing.
Early in January, level the ridges with a fork, working
the whole of the surface soil over, and towards the
end of the month, make the first sowing, choosing
Mazagan and other early varieties. Mark out two rows,
9in. asunder, leave a space of 30in., then another two
rows, and so on throughout the piece sown. If preferred,
they may be sown in single rows at intervals of 1¬Ωft.
The drills should be about 3in. deep, and the seed from
7in. to 9in. apart in the rows. Where the double-row
system is adopted, arrange the seed for the plants to come
alternately. In March, get in the main sowing of the
Broad and later Long-podded kinds, in the manner already
described; another sowing for late use may be made in
April. When the plants are about 6in. high, earth up as
recommended for those sown in the autumn. As soon as
a good crop is set, pinch out the tops of the plants, to assist
the maturation of the Beans, and prevent the attacks of the
fly. Figs. 209, 210, and 211 are excellent representations
of the flowering plant, pods, and seed of the Broad Bean.</p>

<p><em>Sorts.</em> For early use: Early Mazagan, Long-pod, Marshall's
Early Prolific, and Seville Long-pod. For late use:
Carter's Mammoth Long-pod, and Broad Windsor (white
variety). These are all distinct and good varieties.</p>

<em>Cultivation</em>: This class (see Fig. 212) also requires a rich
and deeply trenched rather light soil. A very important
point is to get the ground into a good condition, by frequently
forking it over; and, as the seeds are not sown
till the beginning of May, there is plenty of time for the
work. The finer the soil is, and the more it is a√´rated,
the better will it suit the crop. From the beginning of
May till the end of June, at intervals, draw out drills
about 2ft. apart, and 3in. deep, and in these place the
Beans tolerably thick, as generally they are not all certain
to grow. As soon as up, carefully thin them, and slightly
earth up to prevent the wind blowing them about. They
should not, however, be earthed higher than the seed leaves,
or they will probably rot off in wet weather. Keep free
from weeds, and maintain a sharp look out for slugs. In
dry weather, water occasionally, giving good drenchings,
and not mere sprinklings, which do more harm than good.
A good mulching of half-rotted manure is very beneficial,
as it prevents evaporation to a great extent, besides affording
some amount of nourishment to the plants. Great care
must be taken to pick off the Beans as soon as large enough
for use, or they will exhaust the plants. Where seeds are
needed, a number of plants should be left for the purpose,
and these should be some of the best, to prevent deterioration,
or loss of the true variety.</p>

<p><em>Forcing.</em> French Beans require more heat than can be
obtained in either a frame or an ordinary greenhouse; and,
although easy enough to grow in a structure suited to their
requirements, yet, if such does not exist, they are almost
sure to fail. A good heat, from 60deg. to 70deg., with
abundance of moisture, is necessary for successful results.
Plenty of light is also most essential. A position such as
that of a cucumber house is generally a suitable one; but
the plants must not be placed under the cucumbers. Successional
sowings in pots or boxes must be made, from the
end of August till March, to keep up a supply. For soil,
use good maiden loam, with a little well-rotted manure
added. Use 8in. pots, sowing five or six beans in each.
The first sowing should be placed in a frame and kept
well watered, bringing into heat in October; but the subsequent
sowings should be placed directly in the house.
Keep the soil moist, and the plants free from aphides
and other insect pests, and give air at every favourable
opportunity. The plants should be as near the light as
possible, and kept from falling about by tying or placing
small pieces of Birch wood round them. In dull weather,
it will be found that the blooms will not set so freely as
when the sun shines brightly; therefore, every care should
be taken to secure both heat and ventilation when sunshine
prevails. When the pots get full of roots, and the
plants are bearing fruit freely, a little liquid manure is of
great assistance; at no time must the plants get dry
enough to flag. Allow plenty of room for the full development
of foliage, and maintain a minimum temperature
of 60deg., with plenty of moisture.</p>

<p><em>Sorts.</em> These are very numerous, among the best being
Black Negro, Canadian Wonder, Canterbury, Fulmer's
Forcing, Golden Dun, Newington Wonder, Osborn's Early
Forcing, Sion House, and Sir Joseph Paxton.</p>

multiflorus</em>). <em>Cultivation</em>: Being tall growers, these need
a greater space than the Dwarf French varieties, and
they also require support. Rich soil is indispensable for
them, and liberal supplies of water on light soils and
in dry weather. A good overhead syringing from time
to time is also advantageous. Trench and heavily manure
a piece of ground in autumn, leaving it in ridges for
the winter. In March, level the ridges down, and well
work the ground, to render it friable and in good condition.
The plants being extremely tender, it is not safe
to sow before the end of April or the first week in May.
It is preferable to sow in rows, which should be from
6ft. to 12ft. apart, and crop the ground between with
other vegetables. Earth up and stake them as soon as
ready, to prevent injury from rough wind. A good plan,
which may be adopted to obtain early produce, is to
raise the seeds in boxes in a cold frame, getting them
ready for planting out in the middle of May. Plant at
the same distances, and treat afterwards as recommended
for those sown out of doors.</p>

<p>If preferred, they can be grown on the ground without
stakes. Under this treatment, they must have their tops
pinched off when about 18in. high, continuing this pinching
from time to time as necessary. If this plan is
adopted, the rows need only be 3ft. apart, the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
not being otherwise cropped. In dry seasons and on
light soils, there is an advantage attached to this method,
namely, that those on sticks are liable to injury from
drought, while the foliage of those pinched back keeps
the soil moist underneath.</p>

<p><a name="BED" id="BED"></a><strong>BED.</strong> A term usually applied to pieces of ground laid
out in gardens for sowing small seeds, or for the isolation
and better protection of small collections of plants in the
reserve ground. The oblong is the best shape for this purpose,
about 4ft. or 5ft. wide, somewhat raised, and having a
narrow path on each side, so that the workman may attend
to the plants or seeds without having to tread on the bed.
Any one part of a flower-garden design, cut out in grass, or
otherwise formed, is also generally termed a Bed. When
required to be planted for effect, as in this case, the Bed
should be proportionate in size to the plants that are to be
put in it, always planting the highest in the centre and
gradually sloping, with other sizes, to the edges, which
should be the lowest. Circular Beds are best with one
centre plant; and oblong or other shapes should have the
height of the centre plants carried nearly the whole length,
not, however, placing them in too formal a manner.</p>

<p><strong>BEDDING-IN.</strong> A method of seed-sowing, now almost
obsolete, and chiefly employed in nurseries. "In this
method, the ground being dug and formed by alleys into
Beds, 4ft. or 5ft. wide, each alley being a spade's width
or more between Bed and Bed, and the earth being drawn
off the top of the Bed with a rake or spade, ¬Ωin. or 1in.
deep into the alleys, the seed is then sown all over the
surface of the Bed; which being done, the earth in the
alleys is immediately cast over the Bed, again covering the
seeds the same depth, and the surface is raked smooth"
(Johnson). In the case of small seeds, a very light covering
is needed, and that only of very fine soil.</p>

<p><strong>BEDDING-OUT.</strong> The temporary placing out of doors
of greenhouse and other tender plants during the summer
months. It is considered by some to be the showiest,
most expensive, and most unnatural of any style. The
geometrical arrangement of gaudy colours is not at all
times satisfactory, and under the most favourable conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the design is rarely retained more than two or
three months, say, from July to September. The method
is, however, so extensively adopted as to demand due notice
in this work. Bedding usually commences in May. An important
consideration is the proper preparation of the soil for
the reception of the plants. It will be found to materially
assist the growth if the soil is well dug over a fortnight
before the plants are put in. By this means, it will acquire
a certain amount of solidity, a point of great importance
with fibrous-rooted plants that are subject to injury from
the fine roots not taking a firm hold of the soil. Having
decided upon the arrangement of the plants, proceed to
work with the planting. With round, oval, or, indeed, almost
any shaped bed, begin in the centre and work towards the
edge; in borders, commence at the back and finish with
the front row. Plant with a trowel, disturbing the balls as
little as possible, and when in the holes press the soil
moderately firm. After the Bed is finished, give a good
soaking of water to settle the soil at the roots. Manure
for Flower-beds should always be perfectly rotten, such as
that from a spent hotbed. When the plants are thoroughly
established, water must only be given if they show signs
of distress; and then a good soaking should be applied.
A careful hoeing of the surface after planting will be most
beneficial, leaving it smooth and tidy. A Dutch hoe will
be the best to use. Injudicious use of manure and water
will only cause a foliaceous growth. The proper treatment
of the various Bedding Plants will be found under their
respective headings. For spring decoration, the Beds may
be filled with Dutch bulbs, and spring-flowering annuals
and perennials <em>ad infinitum</em>; or, after the plants are
removed in autumn, the Beds may be filled with evergreens
plunged in pots, such as Aucuba, Arbor vit√¶, Euonymus,
and various little Conifers, which have a bright appearance
through the winter, and can be removed at any time.
With the relative value, or advisability of adoption, of
either or any system of gardening, it scarcely comes within
the province of this work to deal. No hard-and-fast rules
can be laid down as regards "style," and each individual
may follow his own taste and inclination.</p>

<p><em>Carpet Bedding.</em> This mode of gardening, although not
so generally employed as it was some few years ago, has
many admirers, and small plots, geometrically arranged
in multi-coloured beds on lawns, are frequently seen. In
our large public parks, the system is largely adopted, and
evidently proves very gratifying to the multitudes who
visit these places; but probably no system is more unnatural
or expensive, as such a large number of plants
are necessary in order to produce a desirable effect. The
illustrations (Figs. 214 and 215) represent two designs
for Carpet Beds. The numbers placed in the various compartments
indicate the way the different colours should
be arranged, repeats being marked by the same cypher. A
very varied and large selection of plants can be used for
Carpet Bedding, some of which are quite hardy, such as
<em>Herniaria glabra</em> and <em>Veronica repens</em>, two of the best
dwarf green plants; <em>Sempervivum californicum</em>, <em>Sedum
lydium</em>, <em>S. glaucum</em>, <em>Antennaria tomentosa</em>, &amp;c. These may
be planted early in the season, with Golden Feather, and
are especially valuable, as they are generally employed to
a great extent. Other plants, not quite so hardy, are
<em>Mentha Pulegium gibraltarica</em> and <em>Echeveria secunda
glauca</em>, both of which are extensively used; while the
tenderest subjects are Alternantheras of various kinds,
<em>Coleus Verschaffeltii</em> and <em>Mesembryanthemum cordifolium
variegatum</em>. These latter should not be planted till the
first or second week in June. As the plants are usually
small, and require to be planted thickly, the work is best
accomplished with the fingers, pressing the soil moderately
firm. First of all, work out the design, and plant the
leading lines; afterwards fill in the "panels."</p>

<p><em>Sub-Tropical Bedding.</em> This term is applied to the
arrangement of tropical plants in Beds or groups outside
for the summer months, and if discriminately adopted a
very attractive and unique display may be made, depending
greatly upon position, and mainly upon the material at
command. If a sheltered and partially shady situation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
enjoyed, a grand effect may be produced by the grouping
of tree and other large ferns with palms, Cannas, Aralias,
Drac√¶nas, &amp;c., avoiding, of course, formal arrangement, and
yet, when finished, a symmetrical appearance should be
produced. In more open positions, palms, Castor Oil Plants,
Cannas, <em>Humea elegans</em>, Aralias, Phormiums, Wigandias,
Nicotianas, &amp;c., may be employed, the result being, if
properly arranged, most gratifying. Sub-Tropical Bedding
should not be done till the middle or end of June, and the
Beds should be well dug and freely manured for those that
are to be planted out.</p>

<p>Fig. 216 represents a Border or long piece of ground,
which may be either marked out permanently with Box
edging, dwarf-growing silver or golden leaved plants, tiles,
stones, or pebbles, and filled in with silver sand or bright-coloured
stones or gravel; or the lines may be widened out
into walks. The whole of the small circles not numbered
are intended for specimen foliage and other plants, such
as Fuchsias, Yuccas, Aloes, Cannas, Solanums, variegated
or plain Reeds, Grasses, Maize (<em>Zea</em>), &amp;c. No. 1, tall plants
of <em>Echeveria metallica</em>, edged with <em>E. glauca</em>; 2, 2, yellow

<p>Fig. 217 illustrates a design admirably adapted
for a rosery or small flower garden. Its only
fault is the number of sharp angles at the
corners of some of the Beds; but this can be
counteracted by the predominance of curved
lines. It is easily formed, and the effect is good
if furnished in the following manner: The circle

<p>The group of Beds illustrated in Fig. 218 is effective
on grass or gravel. If on the latter, the lines should be
defined with Box, Golden Thyme, Cerastium, or Santolinas.
The design is pretty on level, but is still more effective
on sloping ground; in the latter case, it should rise
from the straight walk (dotted line). Thus each Bed may
be seen to the best advantage, and the group may be
extended to any length. The circular Beds should be
planted with two distinct colours, such as good pink and
scarlet Pelargoniums of similar habits of growth, placing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>

Carpet Bedding.</p>

<p><em>Nursery Bed.</em> This is merely a reserve ground or
nursery for a large stock of plants of various sorts, such as
Roses, &amp;c. One of the first requirements is an easy access
to the individual plants, and with the least possible waste
of space. This may be obtained by arranging the Beds in
regular geometric figures, as shown in Figs. 219 and 220,
and, by exercising a little care and taste, the whole can be
so contrived as to present an ornamental appearance.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Messrs. Cannell and Sons for the
diagrams of Bedding-out designs shown at Fig. 221, which
may be made very effective:</p>

<p>Bed A. This Bed may be planted with the following:
Summer-flowering: 1, Gain's Yellow Calceolaria or Ageratum
Lady Jane; 2, Geranium Vesuvius or another scarlet;
3 and 4, Viola Blue-bell or Purple King Verbena; 5, edged
with <em>Gnaphalium lanatum</em>, or <em>Antennaria tomentosa</em>, white
foliaged plants. Summer Foliage: 1, <em>Coleus Verschaffeltii</em>;
2, <em>Centaurea ragusina compacta</em>; 3 and 4, Mrs. Pollock
Geranium; 5, band of any of the Echeverias, or <em>Kleinia
repens</em>.</p>

<p>Bed B. Plants mentioned for A will do for this.</p>

<p>Bed C. This is really intended for a Carpet Bed. 1,
<em>Alternanthera amabilis</em>, with a narrow line of <em>am≈ìna</em> for
the edge; 2, <em>Mentha</em>, or <em>Herniaria glabra</em>; 3, band of
<em>Mesembryanthemum cordifolium variegatum</em>. Flowering:
1, Any kind of Scarlet Geranium; 2, Golden-leaved ditto;
3, Blue Lobelia (edge). Spring: 1, White Arabis; 2,
<em>Myosotis dissitiflora</em>; 3, Golden Feather.</p>

<p>Bed D. Summer: 1, Pink Geranium; 2, <em>Iresine Lindenii</em>;
3, Golden Feather. Carpet: 1, <em>Alternanthera versicolor
grandis</em>; 2, <em>Mesembryanthemum cordifolium variegatum</em>;
3, <em>Alternanthera magnifica</em>, edged with <em>Sempervivum montanum</em>.</p>

<p>Bed E. 1, Scarlet Geranium; 2, Pink ditto; 3, <em>Lobelia
speciosa</em>; or, 1, <em>Alternanthera am≈ìna</em>; 2, <em>Mesembryanthemum
cordifolium variegatum</em>; 3, <em>Echeveria secunda
glauca</em>.</p>

<p>Bed F. 1, <em>Drac√¶na</em>, <em>Cham√¶peuce</em>, or any other graceful
foliage plant for the centre; 2 and 4, <em>Alternanthera
amabilis</em>, the divided lines, 6, being filled with Mentha or
Echeverias; 3 and 5, <em>Alternanthera am≈ìna</em>; and the
outer edge, 7, with <em>Sempervivum californicum</em>. This bed
would look well if planted with any of the above-mentioned
spring flowers. Spring: Bed might be raised to
a mound, and lined out with hardy Sedums, or Sempervivums,
placing a larger growing one in the centre; and
2, 3, 4, and 5 divisions may be filled with any spring-flowering
dwarf-growing plants.</p>

<p>Bed G. 1, Small plant of Yucca; 2, <em>Coleus Verschaffeltii</em>;
3, <em>Alyssum variegatum</em>; 4, <em>Lobelia pumila magnifica</em>.</p>

<p>Bed H. 1, Golden Feather; Mesembryanthemum; 3,
Mentha; 4, <em>Alternanthera amabilis</em>; or 1, <em>Coleus Verschaffeltii</em>;
2, <em>Centaurea ragusina</em>; 3, Calceolaria Golden Gem;
4, Ageratum Lady Jane.</p>

<p><strong>BEDDING PLANTS.</strong> This term applies to many
half-hardy subjects which are planted out in beds for
summer display, such as Ageratums, Calceolarias, Geraniums,
Heliotropes, Lobelias, Verbenas, &amp;c., all of which
will be treated under their respective headings. They are
mostly soft-wooded plants and are easily cultivated with
proper means, in spring and autumn.</p>

<p><a name="BEDFORDIA" id="BEDFORDIA"></a><strong>BEDFORDIA</strong> (named in honour of a former Duke of

<p><a name="BEET" id="BEET"></a><strong>BEET</strong> (<a href="#BETA"><em>Beta</em>,</a> which <em>see</em>). The present varieties of
Beetroot are the offspring of <em>Beta vulgaris</em>, a plant of
biennial duration, and a native of the sea coasts of
Southern Europe. It was cultivated in this country about
1656, but was probably long previously introduced by the
ancient Romans. Beetroot is largely used as salad, more
extensively on the Continent than with us, also pickled;
medium sized, deeply coloured roots being the chief desideratum.
Some varieties are largely grown for their
highly-coloured foliage, being planted in bedding-out designs,
and generally proving extremely effective.</p>

</div>

<p>Cultivation: For obtaining the best results, an open
situation should be chosen, free from the shade of trees.
The ground should be light and sandy, and, if possible, that
which has been previously manured for some other crop,
French beans, for instance. Trench the soil to a depth of
2ft. in the autumn, and ridge it up for the winter. As soon
as dry enough to allow of working in spring, dig over the
whole bed with a steel digging fork, and break the soil
tolerably fine. Sow any time from the last week in April
to the end of May. Prepare the drills about a foot or 15in.
apart, and from 1in. to 2in. deep. The seeds grow quicker
if steeped in water previous to sowing, afterwards allowing
them to get dry enough to separate from each
other. Sow thinly, and fill in the drills with a rake. As
soon as the plants are up, hoe between the rows, and keep
free from weeds. In a fortnight or three weeks after this
hoeing, if the weather has been favourable, the plants will
be large enough for thinning. Thin out to about 9in. apart,
and carefully fill up, in dull weather, any blanks that may
occur. Transplanting is, however, not generally a very
satisfactory method. Carefully lift the roots in autumn,
before frost comes, and wring off the leaves about an inch
from the crowns. Place the roots in a cool shed or house,
and allow the soil on them to get quite dry, when they may
be stored for winter use in dry sand, or soil, in a shed free
from frost. It is preferable to keep the crowns free from
soil, to prevent decay from the ends of the leaves left on
them. If this be carefully done, the roots will keep till the
next season's early crop is ready. In all processes connected
with the growing, storing, or cooking of this vegetable,
the greatest care must be taken to avoid bruising or
otherwise injuring the roots, as deficiency of colour would
be the result, especially in the case of the red-fleshed kinds,
in some cases rendering them valueless for table use.
Seed Saving: When lifting the crop in autumn, select
as many of the best formed and coloured roots as required,
and store them separately from the rest. In April, plant
them in a spot by themselves, where there is no danger of
impregnation from other varieties, and in due time good
seed will ripen. If good foliaged varieties are required,
the best should be selected when growing in the summer,
and either be marked by some means, or have the inferior
ones removed from them.</p>

<p><em>Sorts.</em> These are somewhat numerous&mdash;almost every
seedsman having a so-called "improved strain." Nutting's
Dwarf Red, Chelsea, Pine Apple, Dell's Crimson and Red
Castelnaudary, are the best of the crimson or red-fleshed
kinds. The Egyptian Turnip-rooted is a distinct variety,
with flesh of a good colour, and fine flavour; excellent for
summer salads. Betterave de Bretagne is a Continental
variety; the roots grow to a good size, with a distinct outer
skin of a dark colour; flesh rich purple. The best of the
yellow-fleshed kinds are Small Yellow and Long Yellow
(see Fig. 222); but these are not grown nearly so
much as the deep-coloured section; in fact, they are
almost useless for garden purposes.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Beetroot for Bedding Purposes</em>: In this case, where the
foliage is the main object, the seed may be sown in a reserve
bed, and the plants transferred to their positions in
the flower garden. If, however, a line is required in a
ribbon or other border, the best plan is to sow there, and
thin out the plants to equal distances. Dell's Crimson is
one of the best varieties for this purpose, being very compact
and of a good dark colour.</p>

<p>Varieties of the Leaf Beet (<em>Beta Cicla</em>), and Sea or
Perennial Beet (<em>Beta maritima</em>), are sometimes, but very
seldom, cultivated for the use of the leafstalks and
leaves, the roots being hard and unfit for cooking purposes.
They are at the best but substitutes for other
vegetables&mdash;namely, the midrib for Sea-kale and the leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
for Spinach. If desired, seeds may be sown in the way
described for Beetroot, in April for using in autumn and
winter, and in August for spring use, plants of the latter
sowing being protected in severe weather. The best sorts
are Red-stalked, Yellow-stalked, and White (see Fig. 223)
or Silver Leaf.</p>

<p><a name="BEET_CARRION_BEETLE" id="BEET_CARRION_BEETLE"></a><strong>BEET CARRION BEETLE</strong> (<em>Silpha opaca</em>). This
destructive insect is frequently found in dead animals,
but often its grub almost destroys the leaves of Beet and
Mangold Wurzel crops. The grubs, which are black and
shining, when full grown are from ‚Öìin. to ¬Ωin. long; the
three segments next the head are rounded at the sides, but
the other segments are sharp, and the tail segment has a
sharp spine on each side. "When full-fed, the grubs bury
themselves, and form cells at the depth of 3in. or 4in.
below the surface of the earth, in which they turn to pup√¶,
and from these the Beetle has been seen to come up in
about the space of a fortnight or three weeks" (Ormerod).
The Beetles are flattish, and about five lines long, brown-black,
with a tawny down; eyes large and oval; horns
club-shaped; body somewhat oval; wing-cases very flat,
turned up at the outer edge, each case having three sharp
ridges running along it; tip of abdomen dull red. Any
manures or methods of cultivation that would stimulate
growth in the plants, so as to permit renovation of injuries,
would be found useful. If farmyard manure were applied
to the soil intended for Beet <em>in the autumn</em> instead of in
spring, it would lessen the risk of attack to the Beets.</p>

<p><a name="BEETLES" id="BEETLES"></a><strong>BEETLES</strong> (<em>Coleoptera</em>). Beetles form one of the most
extensive orders of insects, there being upwards of 3000
known British species. They vary much in appearance,
but a Beetle is readily recognised by its front wings, or
elytra; these form a tough horny sheath or case, which
lies over the real wings, and protects them when the insect
is not flying. Sometimes, the elytra are very short (see
Fig. 225); the mouth is fitted with jaws for cutting.
The metamorphosis is complete, <em>i.e.</em>, the larva or grub
is very unlike either the quiescent pupa or the perfect
insect. The period that elapses before Beetles arrive at
their perfect state varies from a few weeks to two or
three years, but is usually rather longer than in Butterflies
or Bees. Various Beetles attack growing plants and roots.
Thus, <em>Otiorhynchus sulcatus</em> and <em>O. picipes</em> attack Vines,
Roses, and other plants, gnawing off the bark. Some
species of Beetles attack Mushrooms, while others bore
into the wood of old trees, or eat leaves (<em>e.g.</em> Turnip Fly),
or burrow in the leaves, or form galls on roots (Cabbage-gall
Weevil). Of some kinds, the beetles are hurtful; of
others, the larv√¶. Many kinds, however, are beneficial,
such, for instance, as the common Ground Beetle
(<em>Carabus</em>, Fig. 224), and the Devil's Coach Horse (<em>Ocypus
olens</em>, Fig. 225). These live upon other insects and
snails. One kind of Beetle&mdash;the Ladybird (see Figs. 226
and 227)&mdash;is very beneficial in a garden, as it preys upon
the aphides, or plant lice. For instructions in dealing
with the noxious kinds, <em>see</em> <a href="#ASPARAGUS_BEETLE"><strong>Asparagus Beetle</strong>,</a> <a href="#BEAN_BEETLE"><strong>Bean

<p><a name="BEET_FLY" id="BEET_FLY"></a><strong>BEET</strong> or <strong>MANGOLD FLY</strong> (<em>Anthomyia bet√¶</em>).
The maggots of this fly do considerable damage by feeding
on the pulp of the Beet or Mangold leaves. The eggs are
small, white, and oval, and are laid in small patches beneath
the leaves; the maggots are about ‚Öìin. long, legless, cylindrical,
and yellowish-white. As it is of such recent appearance
in this country, specifics for its eradication are by no
means numerous; but, according to Miss Ormerod, "the
best treatment appears to be to nip it in the bud, where
such treatment is possible, by destroying the infested plants,
but generally by all means of good cultivation, or by special
applications of artificial manure, to ensure a hearty growth,
which may run the plants on past the power of average
attacks to weaken the leafage to a serious extent."</p>

<em>Baryandra</em>, <em>Casparya</em>, <em>Pritzelia</em>, &amp;c. The rich colours and
beautiful form of the flowers of Begonias, their prettily-marked
foliage, and free-growing, free-blooming nature,
have long marked them out as favourite garden plants.
Within the last twenty years a new race, characterised
by a tuberous root-stock, annual herbaceous stem, and
large handsome flowers, has been introduced from the
Andes of South America, from which, by means of careful
cross-fertilisation and selection, a large number of beautiful
and almost hardy kinds have been raised. The size,
substance, and rich colours of the flowers of the majority
of the plants of this race of Begonias are witness to
what may be done by skilful cultivation and careful cross-breeding
among plants. In the same way the large-leaved,
stemless section, of which <em>B. Rex</em> may be taken as the
type and principal progenitor, have been improved both
in the size and the coloration of their foliage, and countless
forms are now in cultivation, both as garden plants
and for the decoration of rooms, &amp;c. The propagation
of Begonias may be accomplished by means of seeds, which
are freely produced by almost all the cultivated kinds,
by cuttings, by division of the rhizomes, and&mdash;in the case
of the large-leaved kinds&mdash;by leaf-cuttings. For the first
of these methods it is necessary that the seeds should be
well ripened before they are gathered, and kept dry until
sown. Where it is desired to increase any particular
kind of garden origin, seeds are useless, none of the
hybrid or seedling forms perpetuating themselves through
their seeds, although equally beautiful sorts may be raised
from them. The characters of all true species are, however,
reproduced in their seedlings. For the successful
raising of Begonia seeds it is necessary to sow them on
pans or pots of well-drained, light, sandy soil, which should
be well watered before the seeds are sown. The seeds
should not be covered with soil, or they will fail to germinate.
Over the pans a pane of glass should be placed, and
they should then be stood in warm house or a frame where
a temperature of about 65deg. can be maintained, and
shaded from sunshine. As soon as the plantlets are large
enough to be safely manipulated, they should be pricked
off into pans of light leaf-mould soil, in which they may
remain until large enough to be placed singly in pots.
Cuttings: These strike freely if planted in small pots,
in sand and leaf mould, and placed on a bottom heat of
70deg. Where large quantities are required, a bed of
cocoa nut-fibre in a stove or propagating frame may be
used, and in this the cuttings may be planted and remain
until well rooted. Leaf cuttings succeed best when laid
on sand or cocoa-nut fibre, and shaded from bright sunlight.
In preparing the leaves, old, well-matured ones
should be selected, and incisions made with a sharp knife
across the principal nerves on the underside. They should
then be placed on the sand or fibre and held down by
means of a few pieces of crock. Under this treatment,
bulbils will form on the lower ends of the nerves of each
section of the leaf, and these, when large enough, may be
removed from the bed and potted. With the exception of
<em>B. Evansiana</em> (<em>discolor</em>), an almost hardy species from North
China, all the shrubby species require a warm or intermediate
house for their cultivation, although during the
summer months a frame or sheltered bed answers for most
of them, provided they are removed into their warm winter
quarters on the approach of cold weather. Some of the
species, such as <em>B. Dregei</em>, <em>B. semperflorens</em>, <em>B. nitida</em>, <em>B.
fuchsioides</em>, <em>B. Lindleyana</em>, <em>B. Richardsiana</em>, along with
the hybrids <em>Ascotensis</em>, <em>Knowsleyana</em>, <em>Weltoniensis</em>, and
<em>Ingramii</em>, are grown in pots out of doors all the summer,
and under liberal treatment they form large handsome
specimens, which are of great value as flowering plants
for the conservatory in winter. The tuberous-rooted herbaceous
kinds should be started in heat in February,
and, when vigorous growth has commenced, be gradually
hardened off, for use either as bedding plants or as pot
specimens for flowering in the greenhouse. A mixture of
loam and leaf mould with a little sand and rotten cow-dung
is suitable for the cultivation of these plants in pots.
Liberal supplies of water should be given during the growing
season. As the growth decays, water should be withheld
until finally the tubers may be shaken out of the soil
and placed in dry sand or cocoa-nut fibre, in a house or
shed where a temperature above freezing can be maintained.
<em>B. gracilis</em> and its varieties, <em>diversifolia</em> and
<em>Martiana</em>, are beautiful greenhouse plants, which thrive
well if treated as advised for the other tuberous-rooted
kinds, with the addition of a few more degrees of heat.</p>

<p>The <em>Rex</em> section requires a light rich soil, plenty of
moisture, and a shaded position in a warm greenhouse.
These kinds are often employed with good effect for
clothing peat-covered walls in ferneries, or as an undergrowth
in large tropical houses. Large specimens have
been grown under the stage in a warm house, the shade
and moisture of such a position being exactly what they
best delight in.</p>

<p><em>B. socotrana</em>, an interesting species from the island of
Socotra, is somewhat singular in its requirements. The
stem is herbaceous and annual, and about its base a cluster
of bulbils are formed, from every one of which a plant
will be developed the following year. The growing season
for this species is from September to March, after which
it goes to rest for the whole summer. A tropical temperature
and all the light possible, are essential to the
well-doing of this plant.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the apparent impossibility to
cross any of the shrubby Begonias with the distinctly
tuberous-rooted species; and even the species of the
shrubby section, whose stems are semi-tuberous, have
hitherto refused to commingle with the South American
tuberous kinds, of which <em>B. Veitchii</em>, <em>B. ros√¶flora</em>, and
<em>B. boliviensis</em> may be said to be typical. The infusion
of the blood of these large, handsome-flowered kinds
into the tall, shrubby species, would almost certainly
result in the production of a race of splendid winter-flowering
greenhouse plants, and it is therefore in every
way desirable that no pains should be spared to break
through the obstacle to the union of the two races.</p>

<p><strong>BELL GLASSES</strong>, or <strong>CLOCHES</strong>. These are used
for the purpose of protecting or accelerating the growth of
a plant or plants. The French Cloche (see Fig. 237) is
largely employed for this purpose. Ordinary Bell Glasses
(see Fig. 238) are exceedingly useful for propagating purposes,
especially for hard-wooded plants; or for placing over
subjects which require a very moist atmosphere, such as
Filmy ferns, Cephalotus, &amp;c.; or for covering half-hardy
plants or rare alpines, and thus protecting them from excessive
moisture. Large Bell Glasses, inverted, serve as
miniature aquaria, and many small aquatics are easily
grown in them.</p>

<p><a name="BELLIS" id="BELLIS"></a><strong>BELLIS</strong> (from <em>bellus</em>, pretty, in reference to the
flowers). Daisy. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Composit√¶</em>. A genus of hardy herbaceous
perennials, distinguished from allied genera in
having conical receptacles and an absence of pappus.
They grow well in all loamy soils. The garden varieties
are increased by division after flowering, each crown
making a separate plant. The soil must be pressed about
them moderately firm. Seeds may also be sown in March, but
the plants thus obtained are seldom of sufficient floricultural
merit to perpetuate.</p>

<p><strong>BELLOWS.</strong> These were formerly employed for fumigating,
but are now entirely superseded by the ordinary
fumigators. The Sulphur Bellows is a very useful instrument
for the uniform distribution of flowers of sulphur on

is very like those in common domestic use, but has a rose of
small holes at the end of its nozzle, through which the
sulphur is ejected.</p>

<p><strong>BENDING-DOWN</strong> the branches of fruit trees, by
means of weights or string attached to pegs driven into the
ground, is sometimes resorted to for the purpose of acquiring
a particular shape, or fruitfulness; but authorities
differ as to the usefulness of the plan for the latter purpose.
Young trees that are inclined to grow strong in the
middle may be more evenly balanced by adopting the plan
of Bending the strong branches, and so diverting the sap to
the weaker ones.</p>

<p><a name="BERBERIS" id="BERBERIS"></a><strong>BERBERIS</strong> (<em>Berberys</em> is the Arabic name of the fruit,
signifying a shell; many authors believe this to be the
original derivation of the word, because the leaves are
hollow, like a shell). Barberry. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Berberidace√¶</em>. Including
<em>Mahonia</em>. A genus of hardy erect or trailing shrubs.
Flowers yellow or orange, racemose or fascicled; sepals and
petals similar, in two series. Leaves simple or compound,
alternate or fascicled from the non-development of the
branches, often spinose, or reduced to spines. The common
sorts thrive well in any ordinary garden soil, but the rarer
kinds require a compost of loam, peat, and a little sand.
Propagation may be effected by suckers or layers, put down
in the autumn; by ripened cuttings, taken at the same
time, and planted in sandy soil, in a cold frame; or by
seeds, sown in the spring, or, preferably, in the autumn,
when, if fresh from the pulp or berry, they will germinate
in the open in the following spring. The last-named is
the method generally adopted.</p>

<p><a name="BESOM" id="BESOM"></a><strong>BESOM</strong>, or <strong>BROOM</strong>. Birch-brooms are best for
garden purposes, and are generally used. The most suitable
for paved yards are those made of the common Ling
(<em>Calluna vulgaris</em>). Those made of bass fibres are frequently
used on paths, for which they are very suitable,
but their expensiveness prevents them being generally
employed. Whatever material is used in its composition,
a Besom will last much longer if soaked in water for some

Squill-like, bulbous plant, from Mexico. Perianth
bell-shaped, six-parted. Leaves narrow, linear. It requires
a compost of loam, leaf soil, peat, and sand, with
good drainage. If cultivated in pots, a plentiful supply of
water must be given from the commencement of growth
until ripening off. When at rest, however, it should be
kept dry and cool, but secure from the effects of frost.
If planted out, a well-drained sunny position must be
chosen, such as close to the wall of a greenhouse with a
southern aspect. Propagation may be effected by offsets.</p>

<p><a name="BETULA" id="BETULA"></a><strong>BETULA.</strong> (according to some authorities, from <em>Betu</em>,
its Celtic name; others give the derivation of the word as

were made of Birch rods, being used to drive back the
people). Birch. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Cupulifer√¶</em>. T<span class="smcapa">RIBE</span> <em>Betule√¶</em>. Ornamental,
hardy (except where otherwise specified), deciduous
trees or shrubs, allied to <em>Alnus</em>, having round, slender,
often drooping branches, and the bark in most species in
thin membranous layers. The flowers appear at the same
time as the leaves. Male catkins cylindrical, lax, imbricated
all round with ternate concave scales, the middle
one largest, ovate; corolla none; filaments ten to twelve,
shorter than the middle scale, to which they are attached.
Female catkins similar, but more dense; scales horizontal,
peltate, dilated outwards, three-lobed, three-flowered;
corolla none. Nut oblong, deciduous, winged at each side.
The Betulas are easily cultivated in any ordinary soil;
but a light sandy loam suits them best. Most of the
species are best increased by seeds, which ripen in September,
and need to be dried, in order to prevent fermentation.
They should be sown in March, in a sandy
soil, the surface of which has been previously made perfectly
level. They must be
spread on the surface, and not
covered with soil, but pressed
down with the feet. When
grown in quantities, beds 4ft.
in width are preferred, with
an alley of 1ft. between
them. In early summer, if the
weather be warm and dry, the
beds should be shaded with
branches. The young seedlings
must be transplanted when a
year old. The dwarfer kinds
may be propagated by layering
in the autumn. The numerous
beautiful varieties are best increased
by grafting or budding
upon seedling stocks of the
common kinds, the former being
done in spring, and the latter
in summer when the buds are
ready. Those most useful as
forest trees and for protection
are quick-growing and very ornamental.
The time of maturity
of the Birch depends very
much upon the soil and situation,
but it seldom increases in
size after it is thirty years old.
The common species (<em>B. alba</em>)
is one of the hardiest and most useful trees in cultivation,
growing quickly, and withstanding exposure better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
many others; consequently it is invaluable for skirting and
nursing more tender subjects, and is especially desirable for
clothing mountainous and exposed districts. It is also very
beautiful and picturesque. It is the commonest tree
throughout Russia, from the Baltic to the Eastern Sea, frequently
monopolising gigantic forests. In Italy, it forms
excellent forests up to 6000ft. altitude, and in our own
Highlands of Scotland it occurs up to a height of 2500ft.
In Greenland, although much reduced in size, it holds its
own as the only arboreal vegetation.</p>

<p><a name="BIGNONIA" id="BIGNONIA"></a><strong>BIGNONIA</strong> (so named by Tournefort, in compliment
to the Abb√© Bignon, librarian to Louis IV.). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>.
<em>Bignoniace√¶</em>. A large genus of usually scandent shrubs,
furnished with tendrils; rarely erect trees or shrubs.
Flowers axillary and terminal, usually panicled; corolla
with a short tube, a campanulate throat, and a five-lobed,
bilabiate limb. Leaves opposite, simple, conjugate,
ternate, digitate or pinnatifid. These handsome plants
are particularly suited for large houses, where, if well
grown, they give great satisfaction. The primary point
in their culture is to obtain free and, at the same time,
sturdy growth, giving due attention to training, pruning,
&amp;c., or the plants soon exceed all limits. Like all free-growing
plants, Bignonias thrive best planted out in the
borders of the stove or greenhouse, or out of doors, as the
case may be; but the space allowed should be limited, in
order to restrict root production. They may either be
trained to cover the back wall, or be planted in a border
in front, and trained up the rafters, or on wires, arranged
where most desirable. In summer, allow all the strongest
shoots to grow, training them so as to have as much
sunlight as possible&mdash;which is absolutely necessary to well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
ripen the wood, and make it capable of producing flowers&mdash;without
entirely shutting it out from the plants below.
Soil: A compost of two part fibrous loam, one part peat,
one of leaf mould, and a due proportion of sand, will be
found most satisfactory. The loam and peat should be
used in a rough state, unsifted, as this will keep the border
open for some years, and thorough drainage should be
effected. Propagation: Seed being rarely procurable, the
most satisfactory method of propagation is by cuttings,
made of good strong shoots, in early spring. Three joints
are sufficient to make a cutting, if short-jointed; if
long-jointed, two are sufficient. Place them in a well-drained
pot of sandy soil, under a bell glass, in bottom
heat. As these cuttings are young and fleshy, they are
liable to damp off; hence it is necessary, for the first
two or three weeks, to wipe the moisture from the glasses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
every morning, and water sparingly. If well managed,
they will root in about two months, and should then have
the glasses left off every night for a week; they should
then be transferred to small pots in the compost above
described, passing it through a coarse sieve, to extract the
stones and rough pieces of soil. After potting, the plants
should be kept close for a short time, till they are able to
bear full exposure to the light. In a year's time, they
will be large enough to plant out in their permanent
quarters. Bignonias may also be increased by layering.</p>

<p><a name="BILLBERGIA" id="BILLBERGIA"></a><strong>BILLBERGIA</strong> (named after J. G. Billberg, a Swedish
botanist). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Bromeliace√¶</em>. A genus of handsome stove
plants. Flowers borne on light panicles; calyx three-parted;
corolla of three convolute petals, scaly at the base;
stamens inserted into the base of the perianth. Leaves
harsh, rigid. These require much the same treatment as
recommended for <em>√Üchmea</em>. The most suitable soil is a
mixture of peat, leaf soil, and loam in about equal parts,
to which is added some sharp sand, to keep it open and
porous. Free and perfect drainage is absolutely necessary
for the successful culture of this class of plants, and
a layer of moss should be placed over the crocks previous
to filling the pots with soil. Although fond of heat,
Billbergias will, when in flower, bear removal to a cooler
house than a stove; and, if they are kept a little dry at
the same time, the change will greatly prolong their
blooming period. The stronger growing kinds thrive well
in rich, well-drained loam and leaf mould. Propagation
is effected by carefully taking off the suckers which
form at the base, after the plants have done flowering;
but, before doing this, they should be allowed to attain
a good size. The suckers grow quickly when attached to
the parent stem, from which they derive their strength,
and feel the check less when severed; besides which, they
become more mature, and are in better condition for rooting.
The best method to adopt is as follows: Take the
sucker in the hand and gently twist it off the stem; next
trim the base by the removal of a few of the lower
leaves, and then insert each sucker separately in a small
pot, in sharp soil. A bottom heat of about 80deg.
will greatly facilitate new root-growth; failing this,
they will root freely in the temperature of a stove if
placed in a shaded position for two or three weeks,
after which they will bear increased light and sunshine
during the later part of the day. <em>See also</em> <a href="#AECHMEA"><strong>√Üchmea</strong></a> and

<p><a name="BIRDS" id="BIRDS"></a><strong>BIRDS.</strong> As a class, Birds are very much more useful
than hurtful in gardens. Owls are of great use in catching
mice, and Night-jars in catching night-flying insects.
Rooks are very useful in lessening the numbers of wire-worms,
and of hurtful insects in general; but, if very
numerous, they may be driven to eat potatoes and other
vegetable food, and may then do harm. The same may
be said of Starlings. Blackbirds and Thrushes feed
much on snails and worms, but they also feed on the
ripe fruits in gardens. As a rule, slender-billed birds
feed almost wholly on insects or other animals, and are
to be encouraged in gardens at all seasons. Among
these may be enumerated the Tree-creeper, Wryneck,
Warblers, and Wrens of various kinds, Chats, Hedge-sparrow,
Larks, Redstart, Robin, Titmice, and Wagtails.
Swifts, Swallows, and Martins, are also great destroyers
of insects. The Finches feed, in part, on insects, but
also eat large quantities of seeds, and often do considerable
damage among plants grown for seed, <em>e.g.</em>, Cabbages,
and in the seed-beds. Sparrows are about the most
troublesome, though they are often assisted by Buntings,
Chaffinches, Linnets, and others. When seed-beds or
fruits have to be protected, this may be done by nets;
or, more simply, by threads tied to sticks a few inches
above the surface of the ground, or in front of the trees.</p>

Fig. 254) is found on many herbaceous plants. It is
very injurious to Beans; hence, immediate means of destruction
must be employed directly the insect appears.
Its extermination is an extremely difficult matter; but
the following remedies are very effectual:</p>

<p><em>Tobacco Water.</em> This, made and applied as recommended
for <a href="#APHIDES">Aphides</a> (which <em>see</em>) is a good remedy; but it is rendered
more certain by the employment of soapsuds, instead
of clear water, in its manufacture.</p>

<p><em>Paris Green</em> (Arseniate of Copper). Owing to its poisonous
nature, this should not be used where there is fruit on
the trees or vegetables under them; but there is no better
destroyer of hard-dying insects. Its application is very
simple. Mix 1lb. of the green with 30gals. of water,
and well wet the infested parts of the trees, using a fine-rosed
watercan or garden engine for the purpose. The
operator's hands should be free from sores and scratches,
or dangerous ulcerations may ensue.</p>

<p><em>Gas Liquor.</em> If this can be obtained from a gas-house, it
should be diluted with twice its bulk of water, and applied
in the same manner as Paris Green, being washed off with
clean water in a few hours. If the process be repeated on
two or three consecutive nights, it will be found certain in
its effects; moreover, it is not very poisonous. The finger
or thumb, or the Aphis brush, applied early, will often
exterminate these obnoxious insects at once. The first
of the methods above described is perhaps the most accessible
and the safest to use. Poisonous insecticides are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
more or less dangerous, especially in the hands of the inexperienced.
Black Fly is, however, one of the most
difficult insects to eradicate, especially if allowed to
multiply. A syringing of clean water should follow either
of the above applications. <em>See also</em> <a href="#APHIDES"><strong>Aphides</strong>.</a></p>

ones dilated, and somewhat sheathing at the base; others
shorter and more distant, appearing on the flower-stem. The
best soil in which to grow them is loam and peat in equal
proportions, with a little rough silver sand added. They
should be repotted moderately firm in the autumn, allowing
good drainage, and should then be placed under the
greenhouse stage, or in any other position where they will
be free from water drippings. Water must only be given
when dry, until they commence to grow, when it may be
gradually increased, and they may be introduced into a
higher temperature, if necessary, there to remain till after
flowering. When the foliage is ripened off, they may be
stored away until the time for repotting. Propagated

Pseudo-bulbs round, flattened. The flowers are freely
produced when the plants are thoroughly established, and
are valuable for bouquets, as well for their pleasing colour
as for the time they last in perfection. Bletias thrive
best in a compost of loam and leaf mould. About 2in.

in the bottom of the pot, which should be filled to within
1in. of the top with soil. The bulbs should then be inserted,
and just covered. A good supply of water during
the growing season is necessary, and only a moderate
amount of heat. After growth has ceased, a period of
rest is required, during which time very little water
should be given. Propagation is effected by divisions,
which should be made after the plants have finished
flowering, or previous to their starting into growth.</p>

<em>Papaverace√¶</em>. Two of the species are greenhouse or half-hardy
shrubs. Flowers inconspicuous, in terminal panicles,
with the branches and branchlets each furnished with one
bract. Leaves stalked, glaucous, large, lobed. This genus
does not well agree with the rest of <em>Papaverace√¶</em>, from its
having one-seeded capsules and apetalous flowers. <em>B. cordata</em>
is a handsome, hardy, herbaceous plant, with a stately
habit and finely-cut foliage, and, where bold subjects are
desired, few will be found superior to it. As an isolated
specimen on the lawn, or by frequented walks, where it
will not be too closely surrounded by tall plants, it may be
grown with marked effect. It also forms a good subject
for pot culture, and is largely used for sub-tropical bedding.
The soil most suitable for its culture is a good fat loam, of
considerable depth. Propagated by cuttings, taken from
the axils of the larger leaves, during early summer; or
by young suckers, taken from established plants, during
summer, as they will then flower the following season. If
the former method is employed, the cuttings should be
pushed on, so that there are plenty of roots before the
winter sets in. The other two species require greenhouse
culture; but both are eminently suited for sub-tropical
gardening, in any light rich soil, or well-drained and airy
situation. They are best propagated by seeds, sown in a
hotbed in spring, the seedlings being placed out from June
to September.</p>

<p><a name="BOILERS" id="BOILERS"></a><strong>BOILERS.</strong> These are very important articles in all
gardens where there are glass houses, and the best should
always be selected. They are made in cast and wrought
iron, both of which have their special advantages and disadvantages.
The former are less liable to burn through
when encrusted with any deposit from the water, but will
crack with sudden changes of temperature, by reason of
the granular form of the metal not allowing gradual contraction;
the latter may burn through where there is
any deposit of mud or other matter, but they will not
crack, and will stand a greater pressure than those made
of cast metal. It is, however, the better plan to use
Boilers of wrought iron, as, with careful usage, they
are less liable to break down in hard frosts than are
the others. As the value of the plants, as well as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of the Boiler, has to be considered, should such a contingency
occur, it is certainly advisable to reduce all risks
to a minimum; and as the average life of a Boiler is from
ten to fifteen years, a slightly larger first cost is not of
very serious moment. The forms of Boilers are very
diverse, and, in some of the patented forms, complicated.
But, whatever the shape, the following points are essential:
A clear and unrestricted waterway of not less than 2in. in
thickness; the greatest exposure of surface to the direct
action of the fire; a sufficient fire space; and a fire-bar
area calculated to supply enough fresh air to the fire to
support thorough combustion. The forms generally used
for horticultural work are the following, or some modifications
of them; and, however grand the name, their
chief value consists in the attested heating capacity
at a given cost: The Saddle Boiler, which is made of
various sizes, with or without check ends, cross tubes,
and other devices for increasing the heating surface, and
also of a tubular form; the Upright Cylinder (a vertical
section of which is shown in Fig. 260); the Upright
Tubular Cylinder; the Horizontal Tubular; and the Cornish
or Horizontal Cylinder. Combinations of the various forms,
and complicated patterns of different kinds, are made for
particular purposes; but in no case should large Boilers be
used, unless they are recommended, by one competent to
judge, as suitable for the purpose they are needed to
fulfil. In every case, it is necessary that the Boiler should
be fixed in a proper manner. It is also good policy to have
Boilers about 30, or even 50 per cent., more powerful than
is actually required, when they are new, as, from various
causes, their heating power falls off in a year or two
in many places; and, under ordinary work, it is not
desirable to stimulate the action in order to command
sufficient heat. There is no doubt that, for general purposes,
some modification of the Saddle or Cylinder Boiler
is by far the best, all things duly considered; but it is
impossible to give any practical advice without a thorough
knowledge of the requirements of any particular place.
Gas Boilers are also useful for small places. These are
made in many forms, and are, as a rule, in the shape of a
cylinder, with a coned inside, against which the flames
play. Some Gas Boilers have also a superheater attached;
this exhausts the heat from the air which has passed
through the Boiler. Another good form is made of horizontal
tubes, which contain the water, the flames playing
over and amongst them. An atmospheric burner of
approved construction should be used where gas is the
heating power. A sufficient supply of gas should be
assured by using supply pipes of a good size. Care should
be taken to keep these pipes free from water, and protected
from frost by silicate cotton lagging, or some other
good non-conductor. Except for very small places, however,
gas apparatus is almost useless, and will never supersede
fuel Boilers. For other particulars regarding Boilers,

of this rather large genus demanding mention is <em>B. edulis</em>
(see Fig. 261), which is considered an excellent article of
food. It is easily distinguished, and is often of large size
and somewhat unshapely; the pileus is usually of a dusky
yellow or brownish hue, but sometimes brighter and more
of a chestnut colour; the flesh is white, and does not change
to a blue colour when cut (this is a very important characteristic,
and should always be noticed). It is a species
common in most districts, usually growing in woods, and
appearing chiefly in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="BOMAREA" id="BOMAREA"></a><strong>BOMAREA</strong> (derivation of name doubtful). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>.
<em>Amaryllidace√¶</em>. A genus of handsome half-hardy twiners,
closely allied to <em>Alstr√∂meria</em>, from which it is chiefly distinguished
by its twining habit and some difference in
the capsule. They are of comparatively easy culture,
thriving in a compost of peat, leaf mould, loam, and sand,
with good drainage. Manure water should be given during
the season of growth. Although they make fine pot
plants, their full beauty is only developed when planted
out in the conservatory or greenhouse border. Propagated
by seeds, or by careful divisions of the underground stem.
In making a division, it is necessary to observe that the
part taken has some roots by which to live till new ones
are formed. It should be potted at first, and may, when
established, be planted out or shifted on. Seeds may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
raised in a warm house without difficulty. They germinate
in a few weeks; and when the young plants are 2in.
or 3in. high, they should be placed separately in small
pots, shifting them on as necessary, or planting them out.
In favoured southern localities, several species have proved
hardy, but they are much the best when grown in a greenhouse.</p>

<p><a name="BORDERS" id="BORDERS"></a><strong>BORDERS, FLOWER.</strong> Small beds, or a continuous
bed, of greater length than width, skirting a wall or
shrubbery, and containing plants of a heterogeneous
character. They should be slightly raised above the surrounding
level, and thoroughly drained. In the first preparation
of the Border, it is most essential to deeply dig
or trench the ground, thoroughly incorporating a large
amount of well-bodied manure; and if the soil is very stiff,
wood ashes or coarse sand should be well worked in with
the manure. The best time to plant such Borders is in
early autumn or in March.</p>

<p>Where, as is frequently the case, the Borders are only
2ft. or 3ft. wide, not more than two rows of plants, either
in groups or singly, will be allowable. The tall plants or
shrubs should constitute the background, with dwarfer subjects
in front; but formal arrangements must be avoided.
The object should be to secure a continuous succession of
flowers. This would entail some little trouble at first,
which, however, would be amply repaid by results.</p>

<p>No hard-and-fast rules can be laid down as to the arrangement
of the plants, which depends on individual taste and
means; but the best results are obtained when the border
is mainly made up of hardy herbaceous perennials, as permanent
occupants, assisted by liberal quantities of summer
bedding plants, such as Dahlias, Fuchsias, Geraniums,
Heliotrope, Trop√¶olums, &amp;c., as well as many hardy annuals
and biennials. By this means, a very varied and beautiful
display may be maintained, especially if bulbs are used for
early spring effect, such as Narcissi, Scillas, Snowdrops,
Tulips, &amp;c. Of course, the herbaceous perennials should
be selected with much care, all weedy subjects being
avoided, and variety in colour and time of flowering secured.
Anything like a full list of these would occupy too much
space for repetition here, but the following will be found
very showy and useful: Achilleas, Aconitums, Anemones,
Aquilegias, Armerias, Asters, Campanulas, Carnations and
Picotees, Delphiniums, Dodecatheons, Doronicums, Fritillarias,
Funkias, Gaillardias, Geraniums, Geums, Hollyhocks,
Iberises, Irises, Liliums, P√¶onies, Papavers, Pyrethrums,
double and single, Ranunculus, Trolliuses, &amp;c.</p>

<p><strong>BORDERS, FRUIT.</strong> These should be well drained,
and if not naturally so, the soil should be excavated from
3ft. to 5ft. deep, in order to form a bottom of stones, pieces
of brick, clinkers, &amp;c. Where it is convenient, draining
pipes should be added, if an outfall in the vicinity can
be secured. The base of the Border should be sloped to
the front, where the pipes should be laid, and the bottom
covered with draining material, thereby effectually preventing
the fruit trees rooting deep, which is detrimental
to healthy growth. Gross-feeding vegetables or flowers
should not be grown on the surface, but shallow-rooting
crops will generally do no harm. Many advocate the
surface being kept free from crops of any sort, simply
letting it be freely exposed; whilst others equally as
strenuously condemn this plan. Where necessary, chalk
or some other mineral constituent of good soil which is
naturally absent, may be added; but much animal manure
is rarely required. The depth and width of Border may
vary for different fruit trees, but efficient drainage is in
all cases important.</p>

<p><strong>BORECOLE</strong> (<em>Brassica oleracea fimbriata</em>). An important
division of the Brassica tribe, often cultivated in
gardens under the name of Kale. It comes in very useful
when hard weather has rendered cabbages, &amp;c., unfit for
use, as it endures cold better than most other green
vegetables. Some are also grown as ornamental foliaged
plants. Like all other plants of a similar description, they
require rich soil, and they should be put out in June or
early in July, as it is almost useless to plant this kind of
vegetable after the middle of the latter month. To
obtain the best results, the ground should be deeply dug
and well manured; but it must not be full of crude
manure at planting time, or it will make the plants too
tender and succulent in wet seasons, with the result
that the first sharp frost would cause them to rot.
Good hard-stemmed plants are the kinds most needed,
especially for crops required in spring, when green vegetables
are scarce. Cultivation: Early in April, and again
a month later for succession, the seeds should be sown
thinly in nursery beds, not covering them too deeply. The
soil should be in a friable condition, and it is an advantage
if the first beds be made under a south wall. As soon as
the seedlings appear, if they are too thick, they should be
thinned, as those which are drawn up weak and spindly
are useless. When large enough, they should be carefully
planted out, choosing showery weather, if possible, for the
operation. If it is necessary to plant them in dry weather,
they must be well watered-in. The rows should be from
2ft. to 3ft. apart, according to the variety, and the plants
2ft. apart in the rows; or, if potatoes are planted wide
apart, the Borecole may be arranged between them. Dead
leaves must be cleared away from time to time, but no
green ones should be broken off. When the tops are cut
for use, the stems should not be denuded of foliage, as
they will soon break again and form successional crops.
The plants must be kept free from weeds. After April,
the Kales are of little use; the stems may therefore be
pulled up, and the ground planted with some other crop.
They all require the same treatment, and at their various
seasons come in equally useful.</p>

<p><em>Sorts.</em> The distinct forms are somewhat limited, but
being largely cultivated on the Continent as well as all parts
of Britain on account of its hardy nature, the varieties of
Borecole receive a large number of names that are either
synonymous with, or indistinct from, a few well-known
types. Dwarf Green Curled or Scotch is probably the best
and most grown; other good hardy sorts are Asparagus
Kale (this name is applied to several different kinds, the
best one being in use very late in spring), Buda, Cottagers',
Dwarf Purple, Imperial Hearting, Ragged Jack, and Tall
Green Curled. Melville's Variegated and Variegated Borecole,
amongst others, have fine ornamental foliage.</p>

<p><a name="BORONIA" id="BORONIA"></a><strong>BORONIA</strong> (named after Francis Boroni, an Italian
servant of Dr. Sibthorp, who perished from an accident
at Athens; he collected specimens of many of those plants
which are figured in the "Flora Gr√¶ca"). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Rutace√¶</em>.
Very elegant and useful shrubs, requiring similar treatment
to ordinary greenhouse hard-wooded subjects, and much
aided with a little extra heat in spring, when breaking into
growth. Flowers pretty, pink-purplish, or white; peduncles
terminal, but usually axillary on the extreme branches,
one to many-flowered; pedicels furnished at the base and
middle with two opposite, short bracts, jointed, commonly
dilated under the calyx. Leaves opposite, simple, or impari-pinnate,
entire, or a little serrulated, full of pellucid
dots. They should be placed out of doors from July to
the middle of September; the most convenient place for
them is in pits, as there are then greater facilities for protecting
them from heavy rains and thunderstorms. When
first put out, Boronias should not be fully exposed, but in
the course of a week they may remain open to the full
influence of both sun and air. Potting should be performed
once a year, as soon as the top growth ceases, as
the roots then extend themselves in preparation for their
next year's functions. The best compost for them is one
of peat and maiden loam in equal parts, and about one-sixth
sharp silver sand. Many cultivators, however, prefer
a compost consisting of good fibry peat and silver sand,
together with some pieces of charcoal, smaller or larger,
according to the size of the pots used. The soil should
be rammed firmly in the pots, which must be well drained.
The leading shoots should be pinched, to ensure good
bushy specimens. Propagation may be effected by young
cuttings, or those made from the half-ripened wood; these
should be put into a thoroughly drained pot of sandy soil,
with 1in. of sand on the surface, and covered with a bell
glass, which must be frequently taken off and wiped dry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
When in the cutting state, water must be very carefully
given around the rim of the pot, without taking off the
glass. If placed in a temperature of about 50deg., and
shaded from bright noonday sun, they soon root, when
they may be potted off singly into small pots, and plunged
in sawdust, or cocoa-nut fibre refuse, in which situation
but little water is needed. Pinching repeatedly, when
young, is the only means to secure good ultimate growth.
Air must be given on all possible opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>BOTTOM HEAT.</strong> This is usually secured by
passing hot-water pipes through an air chamber, or
a water tank, beneath a bed of plunging material.
The covering of the tank or chamber is best made
of slate. The heat must be regulated according to
the requirements of the subjects grown; this is
easily accomplished by using the valve. A thermometer
should be placed in the tank or bed.
Bottom-heat is indispensable for propagating plants

greenhouse or conservatory plants, comprising some of the
most showy climbers in cultivation. Their beauty lies in
the bracts, which envelop the small greenish flowers.
<em>B. glabra</em> may be grown in pots, or planted out in the
greenhouse borders; the others are best planted out, as
they root very freely, and plenty of space would be occupied
if allowed, but it is best to limit it, as they bloom
much better. Strict training and pinching are not desirable,
being prejudicial to the free production of bloom;
indeed, the best plan is to allow the plants to ramble freely
over the roof of a moderately high house, or along the upper
portion of a back wall; they will then bloom profusely for
several months in the year, provided proper attention be
paid to watering, and that the plants are in a well-drained
situation. In preparing a border for their reception, the
first point to be considered is the drainage, which must be
perfect. This is best effected by placing a layer of brick
rubbish, 6in. to 9in. in thickness, communicating with the
drain, by which means all sourness and stagnancy of the
soil will be obviated. The bed should be excavated to a
depth of 18in. or 2ft. Three parts turfy loam, and one
part leaf soil, with the admixture of a liberal quantity
of sharp gritty sand, will form a suitable compost for the
culture of Bougainvilleas. The amount of sand incorporated
must depend upon the quality of the other components,
heavy loam requiring more than that which is more
friable. The occasional incorporation of manure in the
compost is not to be recommended; but a liberal application
of liquid manure will be of material advantage, especially
if the root space is limited. When the plants cease
blooming each year&mdash;about November or December&mdash;they
should be dried off and rested; and in February
they should be closely spurred in, the same as with vines,
and all weak leaders removed, so that strong wood only is
left. When grown in pots, they must be started in brisk
heat. They are easily increased by cuttings prepared
from the half-ripened wood; these should be placed in
sandy soil, in a brisk bottom heat, when they will soon
root. Scale, red spider, and mealy bug are the only insects
likely to infest the plants, and recipes for their destruction
will be found under each individual name.</p>

<p><a name="BOUVARDIA" id="BOUVARDIA"></a><strong>BOUVARDIA</strong> (named after Dr. Charles Bouvard,
formerly superintendent of the Jardin du Roi, at Paris).
O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Rubiace√¶</em>. Handsome greenhouse evergreen shrubs.
Peduncles terminal, three-flowered, or trichotomous and
corymbose; corolla funnel-shaped, tubular, elongated, beset
with velvety papill√¶ outside, and a four-parted, spreading,
short limb. Leaves opposite, or in whorls; stipules narrow,
acute, adnate to the petioles on both sides. These
extensively cultivated plants are among the most useful
for conservatory or greenhouse decoration (see Fig. 270.
for which we are indebted to Messrs. Cannell and Sons),
and the flowers are largely employed in a cut state.
Perhaps only two are fragrant, viz., <em>jasminiflora</em> and
<em>Humboldtii</em>. Cultivation: Presuming the grower to be
commencing with young rooted cuttings, these should be
potted off into a mixture of good fibrous loam, leaf soil,
and sand, in equal proportions, to which may be added
a small quantity of peat; they should then be placed in
a temperature of from 70deg. to 80deg. until fully established
in the small pots. It is necessary at this stage
to stop the young plants back to the first joint, and as
they continue to make fresh breaks, to keep on pinching
them back during the whole period of cultivation, or until
sufficiently bushy plants are produced. Many growers
neglect stopping far too much, the result being ill-shaped
and almost flowerless plants. The pinching, of course, can
be regulated by the time the plants are required to flower;
and it is unwise, in most cases, to stop them after the
end of August. When the small pots are well filled
with roots, the plants should be shifted into the flowering
pots, viz., large 48-sized, which are quite commodious
enough to grow very fine plants, a similar compost as in
the first potting, with a little Standen's manure added,
being used, and good drainage provided. A cool greenhouse,
with a damp bottom for the pots to rest upon,
and with a moist atmosphere, is the most suitable place in
which to grow them during late spring and early summer,
the moist air being very desirable as an effectual check
to red spider, a pest very fond of the foliage, which it
permanently disfigures. A cold pit or close frame is
better during the summer months, as a moist atmosphere
and cool bottom are then certain. Ventilation may be
effected during the greater part of the day by tilting the
lights below, and on fine nights they may be removed
altogether. During bright sunshine, shading will be beneficial.
All through the period of active growth, it is
absolutely necessary that the plants should receive plenty
of water, or they will surely suffer; and when the pots are
filled with roots, occasional doses of manure water will be
beneficial. Many cultivators plant them out about the end
of June, in favoured situations, or in spent hotbeds, when
they make very vigorous growth; and, if carefully pinched
and watered, fine specimens are obtained. These are lifted
in early autumn, with a good ball, potted, and kept shaded
for a few days until the roots are again active, when
they are taken to the house in which they are intended
to bloom, and an enormous supply of flowers is secured.
We have also seen Bouvardias planted out permanently
in beds, in prepared pits, in which the winter temperature
was not less than 55deg., with very satisfactory
results; the quantity of bloom being very great.
Of course, with the last-named treatment, it is essential
to give the plants a rest and hardening-off after flowering,
and when they are started into fresh growth to
keep them well pinched and watered. Bouvardias are
liable to the attacks of red spider and green fly. The
former stands little chance of existence if the plants
are kept well supplied with moisture; the latter may
be destroyed by fumigating with tobacco. Mealy bug
are also troublesome, and should be sponged off with
a solution of Gishurst's Compound. Propagation: After
flowering, and a slight rest and hardening-off, the old
plants should be cut back, placed in heat, in a stove
or cucumber pit, and freely syringed, which will cause
them to break freely, and produce a good supply of
cuttings. When the young shoots are from 1¬Ωin. to
2in. long., they are in the best condition for striking.
It is not necessary that they should be cut off at a
joint, as they will root from any surface of the stem;
and, working economically, it is wiser to cut them off just
above the first joint, as other shoots will speedily break
out, which may, in their turn, be taken. Pots about 5in.
across should have previously been prepared for the cuttings,
by being well drained and filled with a mixture of
good fibrous loam, leaf soil, and coarse sand, in equal parts,
with a copious supply of sand upon the surface, into which
the cuttings should be dibbled pretty thickly. A good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
watering must be given without wetting, and thereby
injuring, the foliage. The pots should be plunged in the
cutting case, or in any bottom heat of about 70deg. or
80deg., and covered with a bell glass. All that is then
necessary is to keep them moist and shady during sunshine,
until they are rooted, which, as a rule, is effected in three
weeks' time. When well established, they may be removed
from the case, gradually hardened off, and finally potted
singly into small thumb pots.</p>

solitary, succulent. They are of easy culture on blocks of
wood, with a little moss, suspended from the roof. Water
should be plentifully given during the growing season;
at other times, a very small quantity will suffice. About
seventeen or eighteen species have been introduced, of
which the following only are worth growing:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>B. acaulis</strong> (stemless). <em>fl.</em> large; sepals and petals long, narrow,
greenish and creamy-white; lip large, heart-shaped, and pure
white; base of tube spotted with dull rose. September. <em>l.</em> very

<p><strong>B. Gibbsiana</strong> (Gibbs's).* <em>fl.</em> white, spotted with chocolate,
large, three on each spike. <em>l.</em> rather broad and very thick.
This rare, erect-growing species must be potted in peat and
sphagnum.</p>

<p><strong>B. glauca</strong> (glaucous).* <em>fl.</em> solitary, produced from a sheath at the
top of the bulb; sepals and petals yellow; lip orange, with a
white throat. Early spring. <em>l.</em> of a milky-green. <em>h.</em> 1ft. Vera
Cruz, 1837. A very handsome fragrant species, somewhat difficult
to flower, but this obstacle may be overcome by liberally growing
during the proper season, and giving it a severe dry rest. (B. M.

<p><strong>B. lineata</strong> (lined).* <em>fl.</em> large, very fragrant; sepals and petals
creamy-white; lip large, pure white. <em>l.</em> long, terete, channelled

species. Honduras, 1839. (B. R. 26, 39.)</p></blockquote>

<p><a name="BRASSIA" id="BRASSIA"></a><strong>BRASSIA</strong> (named after Mr. William Brass, who was
sent by Sir Joseph Banks to Cape Coast and the neighbouring
districts as a botanical collector, at the end of
the last century). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Orchide√¶</em>. A genus of tropical
American orchids, very nearly allied to <em>Oncidium</em>, with
which, indeed, Reichenbach unites it. From this genus,
however, <em>Brassia</em> may be distinguished by its simple inflorescence,
elongated tail-like sepals, and short column,
which is quite destitute of the side lobes or ears that form
a marked feature in the species of <em>Oncidium</em>. There are
about seventeen species, of which many are not sufficiently
attractive to deserve the cultivator's attention. They will
succeed either in pots or in baskets, the drainage of which
must be perfect. They require to be potted in good
fibrous peat, broken in pieces not less in size than a
walnut, placed in the warm end of a Cattleya or Brazilian
house, and supplied liberally with water during summer.
In winter, they must still be kept in a tolerably warm
place, and given sufficient water to keep the pseudo-bulbs
from shrivelling. It is useless to dry off until shrivelling
takes place, for experience assures us that when a plant
shrivels it is generally safe to assume that it has been
tried beyond its powers of endurance, and that its constitution
has given way. Propagated by dividing the
plants, when growth has commenced.</p>

<p><a name="BRICKS" id="BRICKS"></a><strong>BRICKS.</strong> In England, the standard thickness of
brick walls is a Brick and a-half, that is, the length of
one brick and the breadth of another. Thirty-two paving
bricks, laid flat, will form one square yard of flooring; if
set on edge, eighty-four will be required for the same space.
The best Bricks for walls are those termed Stocks, which
are well burnt. Grizzells and Place Bricks, being only
partially burnt, are soft and not durable. In various parts
of the kingdom, different clays and methods of manufacture
cause a disparity in the weight and appearance of the
finished article. Several forms are made to suit various
purposes, but the standard size is 9in. long by 4¬Ωin. wide,
by 2¬Ωin. thick, although, since the remission of the duty,
some slight variations occur, owing to shrinkage and other
causes. Fire Bricks are made of a particular kind of clay,
which will stand intense heat when once burnt, and are
used in furnaces and other places where durability under
great heat is a desideratum. Fire-clay should always be
used in place of mortar in building with
these.</p>

<p><strong>BROADCAST.</strong> A method of sowing seeds by means
of the hand, scattering them over the surface of the ground
as equally as possible. It is now superseded, for the
majority of garden and field crops, by drilling, which not
only economises the quantity of seed used, but greatly
facilitates subsequent weeding and thinning out.</p>

<p><a name="BROCCOLI" id="BROCCOLI"></a><strong>BROCCOLI</strong> (<em>Brassica oleracea botrytis asparagoides</em>).
A cultivated variety of the Cabbage, having the young
inflorescence condensed into a fleshy, edible head (see Fig.
280). To grow this popular vegetable successfully, it is
necessary to have rich soil of a good depth, in an open
situation, where the plants can have plenty of sun and
air to keep them sturdy. They succeed the autumn Cauliflower,
and are in season from November till May.</p>

<p><em>Soil.</em> In preparing ground for Broccoli, trench, in the
autumn, to the depth of from 1¬Ωft. to 2ft., and during the
process work in a liberal dressing of rotten farmyard manure.
Ground which has carried a crop of Celery is very suitable
for the strong-growing kinds, as, by planting where the
Celery rows have been, the necessity of trenching is, to a
great extent, obviated. Smaller kinds, however, need to be
planted closer in order to obtain a profitable crop.</p>

<p><em>Cultivation.</em> At the beginning of May, prepare seed beds
on a south border, and sow the earlier and sprouting kinds.
The later varieties would, perhaps, be best sown in April,
but they must not be put in early and allowed to remain
too long in the seed bed. Sow thinly, to get the plants as
sturdy as possible; and, to prevent clubbing, work in a little
soot or wood ashes on the surface of the beds. Care must
also be taken to pick off the club excrescences at planting
time, should there be any, and to destroy the grub inside.
Clubbing is not so frequent in ground which has been well
trenched, and where the plants are not allowed to suffer
from drought. Showery weather should be selected for
transferring them to their permanent quarters. If it is
desired that they should succeed potatoes, they may be
planted between every two alternate rows, and the latter
crop can be removed when ready. Broccoli succeed best
where the ground is firm, and not recently dug or manured.
Planting with a crowbar is preferable to digging the
ground afresh. If grown by themselves, a distance of
from 2ft. to 3ft. should be allowed between the rows, and
an equal distance from plant to plant. Some of the early
varieties will, in favourable seasons, follow the later Cauliflowers,
while the latest will not be fit for use until the
following spring. The heads should be cut as soon as they
are large enough; they will keep good for a week in a
cold place, while a day or two might open them too much
if allowed to remain on the plants. Broccoli which have to
stand the winter are liable to injury from severe frosts, and
some method of protection is necessary. Two plans are
recommended for both large and small gardens, and either
or both may be adopted, as found convenient. The first
is to apply a covering of fern or other dry protective
material, not using too much, but giving sufficient to break
the rays of the sun, which, perhaps, do as much harm
as the actual frost. The other plan is to take up the
plants as soon as the flowers can be seen, and lay them
in under a hedge or wall until required for use. In sheltered
positions, or where there are trees to break the
force of the wind, the covering with dry litter during
severe weather will generally be found sufficient; still, a
little precaution in lifting will frequently save a valuable
crop. Broccoli should never follow a crop of any other
kind of cruciferous plants, particularly Cabbage.</p>

manure is required as soon as the flower-buds appear.
To keep the plants dwarf and bushy, it will be needful
to stop them about three times during the remainder of
the summer and autumn, keeping as near the glass as
possible; they should be housed by the end of September.
These elegant little greenhouse annuals are unrivalled for
affording choice, neat sprays for bouquets during the winter
and early spring months, or for growing as pot plants,
to furnish warm greenhouses or sitting-room windows.
Many of the species and varieties are largely employed for
summer decoration of the flower garden, with highly satisfactory
results; for this purpose, seeds should be sown
in gentle heat early in spring, and the plants transferred
to the flower borders late in June, or early in July, having
been previously encouraged in pots, and well hardened off.</p>

<em>Franciscea</em>. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Scrophularine√¶</em>. Elegant free-flowering
stove evergreens. Flowers sweet-scented; corolla large,
funnel or salver-shaped, with a long tube, and a flat, five-lobed,
obtuse, nearly equal limb. A light rich soil, or a
compost of loam, leaf soil, and peat, is necessary to grow
these plants successfully. Propagated by cuttings, planted
in sand, and placed under bell glasses, in a moderate heat.
When rooted, they should be placed in small pots, in a compost
somewhat more sandy than that already mentioned.
While growing, they require to be kept in a moist stove
temperature, and should be hardened by placing them in
a drier, and somewhat cooler, temperature after each
growth is completed; the pots should be changed as often
as the roots become thick around the ball of earth. The
larger plants flower freely, and should be slightly pruned
in annually, before commencing their new growth, thus
securing neat and compact specimens. Repotting should
be effected directly they have done flowering. The plants
should then be placed in a temperature ranging from
60deg. to 68deg., and both the roots and foliage liberally
supplied with water. When flowers appear&mdash;about October
or November&mdash;the syringing must be less frequently performed.
At this period, if it be desirable to prolong the
flowering season, the plants should be removed to a temperature
of about 48deg. A few administrations of weak
liquid manure during the growing season are of great value.</p>

bulbous plants, from the Cape of Good Hope. Flowers
red, on very long pedicels. Bulbs large. Leaves broad,
horizontal; perianth with an evident longer or shorter
tube, curving upwards, funnel-shaped, deeply six-parted,
deciduous; segments sub-equal, many-nerved, flat, and recurved
at the apex; stamens on the tube much curved
upwards; scape appearing in summer without the leaves;
umbels many-flowered. Propagation is effected by offsets,
of which the large bulbs produce but few. These, when
secured, may be removed after reaching some considerable
size, carefully potted in a mixture of sandy loam
and peat, with good drainage, and kept tolerably warm
and close until established; water must be given but
sparingly until root-action has commenced. The best place
for growing the offsets into a flowering size is on a shelf
near the glass, in a temperature of from 50deg. to 55deg.
With an abundance of water while growing, and kept dry
while semi-dormant, thus allowing them a rest, the bulbs
will speedily increase in size; but it may be years before
flowers are produced. Culture: This may be divided into
two periods&mdash;one of growth, and one of rest. After the
latter period, they should be allowed to start into fresh
growth, without stimulation, and, as soon as started,
liberal supplies of water should be given, and a genial
temperature of from 60deg. to 65deg. maintained, to make
them grow vigorously. Good-sized pots are also necessary,
with a mixture of loam, peat, and sand, in equal parts. They
are usually confined to the greenhouse, or warm conservatory,
but are sometimes successfully grown in a south
border at the base of a wall, planted out in a pit, upon
which the lights may be placed in winter, and matted if
necessary, as they cannot endure frost. A good depth of
soil, consisting of fibrous loam, peat, and sand, in equal
proportions, with good drainage, should be prepared. In all
cases, the bulbs should be planted somewhat deeply. One
of the most satisfactory methods of ensuring the flowering
of these plants consists in subjecting the bulbs, when at
rest, to a hot dry heat of 70deg. or more, which thoroughly
ripens them; but, after this treatment, it will be necessary
to encourage the after-growth to the fullest possible extent.</p>

<p><em>Soil and Cultivation.</em> In February, and early in March,
sow thinly in a cold frame, or carefully prepare seed beds
on a warm south border. As soon as the plants are large
enough, prick them off into prepared soil, to grow on; about
the end of April, transplant into a piece of rich ground,
which has been previously prepared for them, setting in
rows from 2ft. to 3ft. asunder, and 2ft. apart in the rows.
The earlier the plants are put out, the better; and they
should be watered-in when planted, so that they receive
as little a check as possible. They must be kept clear of
weeds, and earthed up as soon an they get a good size.
During severe frost, some light dry litter may with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>

growing over unsightly hedges, fences, &amp;c., and in the wild
garden; it is a rapid grower, and of extremely easy culture.
The stove perennial species should be grown in pots, and
the stems trained up the rafters. Rich loam is the soil most
suitable for their cultivation. Propagated by seeds, or by
divisions of the tuber.</p>

<p><a name="BUDDING" id="BUDDING"></a><strong>BUDDING.</strong> This process consists of taking an eye
or bud attached to a portion of the bark, and transferring
it to another and different plant; it is an operation almost
confined to woody plants, but has been practised with more
or less success upon herbaceous perennials. The stock
should not be budded unless the sap is in circulation, which
is assured if the bark will detach itself easily, when gently
lifted, from the wood.</p>

<p>There are many ways of performing the different
systems, in preparing and inserting the Buds, &amp;c., and all
may prove more or less successful if undertaken when the
Buds and stock are both in a suitable condition. The
principal methods are Shield or T-budding, including the
Circular, Square, and Inverted forms; Flute or Tube-budding,
and Annular or Ring-budding.</p>

<p>The first-named method, which is fully described below,
is very extensively practised for propagating Roses and
stone fruits. It is also coming more in use for the propagation
of many other fruit trees, including Apples and
Pears, especially new or scarce varieties, as the great advantage
of making use of many more of the eyes, to form
separate trees, is thereby attained. In large nurseries,
where skilful propagators are employed, thousands of trees
are annually budded, the majority of them with very successful
results. It is, in most cases, preferable to purchase
established fruit trees, as cultivators require the produce
much quicker than they could get it by propagating trees
themselves. The same system of Budding is, however,
applicable for increasing Roses; and this may be adopted
with every chance of success by even a cottager, if he
takes the necessary care in performing the work.</p>

<p>Rare varieties of ornamental deciduous trees are largely
propagated in this way; for instance, many of the Acers,
Elms, Horse Chestnuts, &amp;c. Evergreen shrubs, such as
Rhododendrons and Hollies, are also rapidly increased in
some establishments by this means.</p>

<p>In the case of fruit-frees, plump wood Buds must be
selected, from medium-sized branches. On some sorts
these are scarce, the majority being Flower-buds, and it is
rather difficult to distinguish between them at the Budding
season. The best time for the operation is from June to
the end of August; but surrounding influences, condition of
Buds, stocks, &amp;c., must be taken into account. Clean cuts,
with gentle and skilful handling, are even more important
in the Budding of stone fruits than of Roses or other
plants, and the ties should be lightly but firmly made. In
all cases, the operation must be performed as quickly as
possible, as both Bud and bark are injured if exposed
to the air for any length of time.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>F<span class="smcapa">IG</span>. 287. <span class="mleft15"> FIG. 288.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>To proceed with the ordinary system of Shield-budding,
the stock (see Fig. 287 <em>a</em>) should first have a longitudinal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
a transverse incision made in the bark, the former about 1in.
long. Next, the Bud should be prepared, removing half the
leaf (see Fig. 288). Hold the branch with the left hand, and
pass the knife from about ¬Ωin. below, gradually upwards
and inwards under the Bud, bringing it out in a similar way
at a somewhat shorter distance above. A portion of wood
will also be taken out, and this is generally removed the
opposite way to that in which the Bud has been cut. By
skilful Budders, it is removed by a sort of twitch from
either end. Great care must be taken not to pull out the
base or root of the Bud at the same time, as this would
render it useless. Should the whole come out together,
leaving a hollow place under the eye of the Bud, it must be
thrown away, and another prepared. The Bud being ready,
loosen the bark at the point where the incisions meet, with
the ivory knife handle, and insert it by means of the piece
of leaf attached. It must then be tied in with soft
matting or bast, to exclude air, but not tight enough to
injure the bark. Shading from bright sun is advisable for
a few days afterwards, and, as soon as the union takes
place, the ties must be frequently examined, and loosened
if necessary. Some prefer Budding late in the season, in
order that the Bud may remain dormant during the winter,
and breaking stronger the following spring. Occasionally,
they are inserted in spring, just at the commencement of
growth. The stocks of the Summer-budded trees should
only be allowed a moderate amount of foliage during the
autumn, and should be cut back to the established Bud
before growth commences in spring.</p>

<p><em>Square and Circular Shield-budding</em> consists in cutting
out a piece of bark of either shape from the stock, and
inserting another piece of exactly the same size, containing
a Bud, and covering with a bandage, or piece of sticking
plaster, all except the eye. This mode is seldom made use
of. Inverted T or Shield-budding is preferred in the south
of France for propagating Orange-trees, but is not otherwise
much used. The only difference is that the transverse
incision is made below, instead of above, the other, and the
Bud inserted upwards, making it fit with the bark at the
point where the stock is cut across.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_219a.jpg" width="224" height="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>F<span class="smcapa">IG</span>. 289.</p></div>
</div>

<p><em>Flute-budding</em> is sometimes used, and answers well for
some trees (see Fig. 289). A cylinder of bark is removed
from the stock, and one of a similar size from the scion.
containing Buds, is fitted in its place, being carefully made
air-tight by means of a bandage or grafting wax. Some
prefer splitting the hark, as shown in the illustration.
and laying it over the tube or cylinder; but the parts
cannot be fitted so well as when it is removed.</p>

<p><em>Ring Budding.</em> By this mode, it is not necessary to cut
off the top of the stock. A ring of bark may be removed
from any convenient part (see Fig. 290 <em>b</em>) and replaced with
one containing eyes (see Fig. 290 <em>a</em>). The latter should be
taken from a little larger branch than the stock, as the bark
could then be made to fit better. As in Flute-budding, air
must be excluded by means of adhesive paper and bandages
or grafting wax.</p>

<p>Budding operations may be performed at any time
during the season; but dull cloudy weather, and morning
or evening, are most suitable. If the branch, containing
Buds, cannot be obtained as required for use, the ends may
be placed in water, to keep them fresh; but unnecessary
delay should be avoided.</p>

<p><em>Stocks for Budding upon.</em> For the Cherry, the Wild
Gean, and seedlings from the Morello. make capital stocks
for tall trees and those of moderate growth; and the
Mahaleb, or Perfumed Cherry, for small trees for pots,
bushes, pyramids, or cordons. For the Plum, the Mussel,
Mirabelle, Magnum Bonum, St. Julian, &amp;c., are mostly
used for stocks, the Mirabelle being best for small trees.
Peaches and Nectarines are generally budded on the
Mussel, St. Julian, or Mirabelle Plums; the last are best
for dwarfs. The Apricot is budded on the Mussel or
Mirabelle Plums, for small plants; and the St. Julian Plum
for standards. In France, the Damas Noir, or Black
Damask, and the Cerisette, are also used. They should all
be raised from seeds, and not from suckers. Seeds for
raising plants for stocks may be sown as soon as ripe; but
where quantities are used, the stones are thrown into
heaps, so as to slightly ferment during winter. In the
spring, they are sown in drills or beds, and transplanted
the next year in rows 2ft. or 3ft. apart. and 10in. or 12in.
from plant to plant. The dwarfs are generally budded
the second year, and the standards the third or fourth.
Dwarf trees are budded from within a few inches of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
ground to 1ft. above; standards and riders from 3ft. to 9ft.;
cordons, pyramids, &amp;c., can hardly be budded too low.</p>

<p><em>Rose Budding.</em> Propagation of Roses by Budding is
very extensively practised both with standard trees and
dwarf plants. It is perhaps easier and more certain to
succeed with these than with fruit trees; but the mode
adopted is precisely the same&mdash;that of the shield-shaped
Bud with the core, or root, and the bark attached. For
standards, the common briar of the Dog Rose is the best.
The earlier these are obtained and planted in November, the
better, as roots are then formed at once. For dwarf plants,
the Manetti stock is mostly used, being easily
obtained and had in proper condition almost at
any time when Buds are ready. Plants on this
stock do not succeed in all soils, and suckers
are also very liable to be produced. Budding on
the seedling briar is attended with good results,
and is practised more than hitherto. The De la
Grifferaie stock is also used, more for Tea Roses
than others, and is considered by some to produce
better plants than the Manetti. The shoots
on standard briars should be reduced to about
three of the strongest, selected as close together
as possible, and near the top, the briars having
been previously cut back the desired height at
planting time. Two Buds are sufficient for a
good head; but, for certainty, three may be inserted.
Fig. 291 represents a tall briar with three
shoots; <em>a</em> shows the shoot slit for the Bud; <em>b</em>,
the Bud inserted; <em>c</em>, the Bud tied in. Fig. 292
is a branch showing Buds, the lowest ones of
which are most suitable, being in firmer wood.
Those at the top are often useless. Fig. 293
represents a Bud taken from Fig. 292, <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and
Fig. 294 gives an idea of how the wood is removed. As
previously remarked when describing the system, experienced
Budders remove the wood from either end.
Fig. 294 shows its removal from the lower end.</p>

<p>Budding as close as possible to the main stem is most
desirable. Raffia grass is superior in every way for tying,
which should be performed as soon after the Bud is inserted
as possible. It requires much care, and, of course, the
Bud itself must be entirely free. As soon as the Buds
swell, the tying material should be loosened, and the
top of the stock cut back to the level of the budded
shoot. By Budding late, the Buds lie dormant till the next
spring, and the necessity of tying the young shoots is
dispensed with for that season. The shoots of the briar in
advance of the Rose Buds must be cut back, as shown in
Fig. 295, so soon as the Buds are safely established. The
Manetti and other dwarf stocks are budded on the main
shoot nearly close to, or underneath the ground, and if low
enough to cover part of the rose stem when grown, the
latter often roots as well and assists the stock. Being
small, they may be grown in pots and removed to the
required position at any time.</p>

</div>

<p>Dog Roses, used for standards, are usually collected from
hedgerows, and sold at about 8s. per hundred. Manetti
stocks are increased by cuttings, which, after making one
season's good growth, will be fit for use. Briars are raised
from seed, which may be collected from hedges, and sown
in the autumn, in drills. The seedlings should be transplanted
the first year after sowing, and the following season
they will be ready for working.</p>

<p><strong>BUDDING KNIVES.</strong> The best Budding Knives
are those manufactured by Messrs. Saynor and Co., and
Messrs. G. Hall and Son. They are made with handles of
ivory, shaped in different ways at the end, for the purpose
of opening the bark, in order to insert the Bud. Some
of the blades are made with the edge rounded at the point,
so as to cut the bark without the knife entering the wood
underneath (see Figs. 296 and 297). Others, which may be
used for Budding, and are much better for ordinary use for
cutting flowers, &amp;c., are made with the edge of the blade
carried to a point, as in ordinary knives (see Figs. 298
and 299). Another form has the handle made of some
other material, and a piece of ivory inserted for opening
the bark; this is represented in Fig. 300. The first-named
is the best, if required for Budding only; the second is the
most useful for ordinary purposes, and answers admirably
for Budding as well. None of the other shapes have any
material advantages over these.</p>

<em>Loganiace√¶</em>. A large genus of stove, greenhouse, or half-hardy
shrubs. Flowers small, often tomentose, axillary,
spicate, capitate, or thyrsoid; calyx equally four-toothed;
corolla tubular-campanulate, regular; limb spreading, four-toothed.

<p>The species most extensively grown is <em>B. globosa</em>, which,
among all our other shrubs, is quite unique; but it is only
in the southern or favoured counties of England where it
can be fairly termed hardy. It is readily propagated by
cuttings or by seeds. The latter should be sown in a gentle
heat the spring following the ripening, when they will vegetate
pretty freely. With careful treatment and nurturing
in pots for the first winter, in a frost-proof pit or house, they
may soon be grown into elegant plants. Cuttings of the
ripened wood, put in under bell glasses or hand lights, in a
cool but frost-proof pit, will root slowly during the winter.
They will root all the surer and quicker if each cutting has
a heel of older wood attached to that of the current year's
growth. They are best inserted in fine sand or in very
sandy soil, and require but little water until rooted. As
soon as fairly calloused over or rooted, their further progress
may be much advanced by potting them off, and
plunging them in a bottom-heat of 60deg. or 65deg. This
is by no means an essential to secure success, but it hastens
it, and promotes growth in an extraordinary manner. The
surface temperature should range about the same as the
bottom-heat. Under such treatment, the plants will be
quite fit to place out about the middle of July. A warm,
sheltered situation should be chosen, and a light, rich soil
prepared for them; and if dry weather ensues, they only
require water. South or west walls are, without doubt, the
best situations for them. In all cool or unfavourable
localities, much may be done to ensure success by planting
on a dry bottom, and on poorish soil. A loose, free-and-easy
style of training suits the plants best. This enables
them to yield a great number of their peculiarly formed,
distinct, and beautiful flowers; whereas, anything like a
close, trim course of pruning or of training reduces the
flowers to the lowest number.</p>

<p>Throughout the southern parts of England, and, indeed,
in many places in the north, <em>B. globosa</em> makes an excellent
bush for the shrubbery. It is only during severe winters
that it gets badly cut.</p>

<p>For the other presumably hardy species much the same
plan as the foregoing may be adopted. The greenhouse and
stove kinds may have the same routine of culture usually
employed with plants requiring similar temperatures.</p>

<p><a name="BUDS" id="BUDS"></a><strong>BUDS, FLOWER.</strong> These are developed like Leaf-buds,
from which they differ chiefly in containing one or
more incipient flowers within the leaves&mdash;the flowers
being wrapped up in their own floral-leaves, within the
ordinary leaves, which have their outer covering of scales.
If a Bud be gathered from a Lilac or Horse-chestnut very
early in spring, all the rudiments of the future flowers and
leaves will be found within it, though the Bud itself may
not be more than half-an-inch long, and the flowers not
larger than the points of the smallest pins.</p>

<p><strong>BUDS, LEAF.</strong> These consist of rudimentary leaves,
surrounding a growing vital point, and appear like a
collection of scales arranged symmetrically one above the
other. Leaf-buds universally originate in the horizontal
or cellular system, and are formed under the bark at the
extremity of the medullary rays, and at the margin or on
the surface of leaves, whether perfect or rudimentary.
Deciduous trees lose their leaves, but in the axil of
each a little Bud previously forms, from which fresh
leaves expand the following spring. In some cases, as
in the Horse-chestnut, the Buds are covered with a gummy
exudation. In Privet-trees, Leaf-buds are generally smaller
and more elongated than Flower-buds.</p>

<p><strong>BUFF-TIP MOTH</strong> (<em>Pyg√¶ra bucephala</em>). This large
and beautiful Moth is very common in many districts; it
is easily recognised by the buff-coloured tips of the fore-wings&mdash;whence
its common name; the head, and body
between the wings and abdomen, are ochreous. According
to Newman's "British Moths," "the caterpillars, when full
grown, are about an inch and three-quarters long, and
sprinkled with silky hairs; the general colour yellow, with
black head, black lines running from the head to the tail,
interrupted by a transverse orange band on each ring, and
a black horny plate above the tail segment." They feed
on the leaves of the Lime, Elm, and Oak, among other
trees, and apparently the only remedy is that generally
adopted in exterminating caterpillars, viz., to shake the
branches which are infested, when the pest will be quickly
dislodged, and fall to the ground. Miss Ormerod is of
opinion that "as the caterpillars come down the tree to
the ground for their change to chrysalids, it might be
worth while to throw a few spadefuls of gas-lime, or of
anything they would not cross, in a circle at about a yard
from the tree; or a rough band of any material soaked in
tar, or tar and oil, which would keep wet longer, would
stop them from straying off ... and they might be
cleared in sufficient numbers so as to considerably lessen
future attack." This plan of prevention deserves a trial
in any place where the destructive caterpillars of these
Moths abound. It is almost a hopeless task to destroy
them altogether when once established on the trees, such
specimens as large Oaks being often almost or wholly denuded
of foliage.</p>

fragrant; perianth with spreading segments. Leaves
somewhat fleshy, narrow. Stems short. They are all of
easy culture in a compost of sandy loam. The bulbous-rooted
species are increased by offsets, and the herbaceous
sorts by suckers and divisions. The only species
which can be grown satisfactorily in the open air is
<em>B. annua.</em> All the others should be grown in the greenhouse,
but may be placed in the open during the summer
months.</p>

plant, much resembling the <em>Crocus</em>, from which it differs principally
in having a superior ovary and six stamens. It is
amongst the earliest of spring-flowering plants, the flowers
preceding the foliage; and, like the majority of bulbs,
delights in rich sandy loam. In such positions, they multiply
rapidly from offsets. It is a good plan to take up the bulbs,
divide, and replant them every second year, selecting in
autumn, and renewing the soil or planting in new positions.

<p><strong>BULBOSTYLES</strong> (from <em>bolbos</em>, a bulb, and <em>stylos</em>, the
style). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Composit√¶</em>. A. small genus of stove evergreen
plants, now referred to <em>Eupatorium</em>.</p>

<p><a name="BULBS" id="BULBS"></a><strong>BULBS.</strong> A Bulb is formed upon or beneath the
ground, and is a swollen stock, consisting, in the first place,
of a more or less fleshy disk, which below gives rise to the
roots; secondly, of more or less fleshy coats, or scales,
borne on the disk; thirdly, of a more or less central shoot,
equally borne by the disk, protected by the coats or scales
already mentioned, and formed of rudimentary leaves and
flowers. In some instances, small Bulbs, called Cloves, are
formed at the base of the scales of the original Bulb; these
are destined to reproduce the plant. Shallot and Garlic are
good examples. Bulbs are, in fact, storehouses, husbanding
the strength and energy acquired by the plant during one
season, for the exigencies of the next. They are classified
under two sections&mdash;Scaly and Tunicated. In the former,
the scales of the Bulb are imbricated, as in the Lily; in
the latter, they form continuous coatings, one within the
other, as in the Hyacinth, &amp;c. In several Lilies, young
Bulbs are found growing in the axils of the leaves, when
they are known as Bulbils. Bulbs is also a popular term
given to Dutch Flower Roots, mostly arriving here in the
autumn for spring flowering. Crocus, Colchicum, Cyclamen,
Gladiolus, and several others, are not Bulbs, but Corms.
The flowering season varies according to the different sorts
of Bulbs. The majority may be lifted and kept tolerably
dry during the resting period; but they wither and become
exhausted if not replanted at the proper time, thereby
causing many failures. Dutch Bulbs generally arrive in
September, and the best results are obtained from those
potted or planted at once, although some for succession
may be kept in reserve up till the beginning of November.
The failure in cultivating imported Liliums and other
Bulbs may be often caused by their long-continued confinement
in a dry atmosphere, whereby their vitality
is often almost lost. The roots of some Bulbs are nearly
always, more or less, in action, and these, especially, should
not be kept out of the ground for any length of time.</p>

A small genus of epiphytal orchids, all of which are
beautiful and eminently well worth growing. They may be
grown upon small blocks of wood, or in rustic baskets,
suspended from the roof of the plant stove, where, if
liberally treated with water, and a genial moisture in the
air during the growing season, very little else will be
required to ensure health and vigour. In the dull days of
winter, they should be watered less frequently, but the
plants must not be allowed to exhibit the slightest signs of
distress from drought, or the consequences may be fatal to
their health. When fastening these plants to blocks of
wood, a little sphagnum should be used, for experience
proves that they thrive best when their thin white roots
can escape and hang exposed to the air. If growing them
in baskets, it is preferable first to fasten them securely
upon small pieces of bare cork, then to fill the basket,
and finally to cover the whole thinly with a layer of
sphagnum.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, this genus is not a difficult one to
cultivate; its great enemy is a small white scale, which
secretes itself in the sheathing bases of the leaves. Here
it rapidly multiplies, to the great detriment of the plants;
the leaves soon turn yellow at the base, and drop off; the
whole plant looks sickly, and soon dies, or else requires a
very long time and much trouble to achieve its recovery
to health. To prevent this, the bases of the leaves must
be carefully looked into every time the plants are taken
down to be dipped in water; and, should the slightest
sign of this pest appear, a thorough washing with soft
soap and tepid water must be given, repeating the operation
every day until all traces of the insect are removed.
Red thrip are also apt to work much mischief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
with these plants. They take up their abode in the same
way as the white scale, and if not speedily removed or
destroyed, soon make sad havoc. To put a stop to the
ravages of this pest, a wash should be given, as before
recommended, and after the soap has been rinsed out of
the base of the leaf, a little tobacco powder should be
sprinkled into the hollows, and allowed to remain for a day
or two before brushing it off. This process will, however,
cause a somewhat dirty appearance, but it will ensure
ultimate health and vigour. Propagated by dividing the
plants.</p>

beautiful mauve. A very pretty South American species, resembling
<em>B. candida</em>.</p>

<p><strong>B. candida</strong> (white).* <em>fl.</em> snowy-white, with a slight stain of
yellow on the upper part of the lip, in substance and appearance
like white satin, trimmed with gold; large, sweet-scented, in
gracefully drooping three to four-blossomed racemes, produced
from the axils of the leaves. April and May, lasting about three
weeks in perfection, and sometimes having a second flowering
season. <em>l.</em> one or two in number, dark green, and firm in texture.
<em>h.</em> 1ft. Demerara, 1834. A very compact species, well suited for
basket culture; it should never be allowed to get dry. It may
be distinguished from other species by having a single row of
tubercles, forming a ridge upon each side of the slightly hastate
lip. (B. R. 1927.)</p>

<p><strong>B. decora</strong> (comely).* <em>fl.</em> white or rose-coloured, spotted with red;
lip pure white; scapes erect, five to ten-flowered. Winter.
Brazil, 1852. This species differs entirely from <em>B. candida</em>, inasmuch
as it possesses a long slender-rooting stem, from different
parts of which arise small oval pseudo-bulbs, each bearing a
leaf; a lesser leaf appears at the base of a bulb, and from the
axil of this the scape springs. It is a rather straggling but nevertheless
beautiful species, and is best grown fastened upon long
strips of cork, a little sphagnum being used in the operation;
whilst, to prevent the plant getting too much "away from home,"
the young growths should be twisted back as they advance, and
the practice continued until the pseudo-bulb is ultimately left
near the centre, or in any spot which may appear bare. It likes
strong heat and a very moist atmosphere, when growing; but
during the period of rest, it should be kept cool and dry. See

<p><strong>B. pubescens</strong> (downy). <em>fl.</em>, sepals and petals snow-white; distinguished
by the somewhat hastate lip, which has three yellow
ridges on each side, and also by the downy column. November.
<em>h.</em> 6in. Brazil, 1850.</p>

<p><strong>B. rigida</strong> (rigid).* <em>fl.</em> purplish-white, spotted with pink on the

produced in heavy pendulous clusters at various seasons of the
year; lip stained with yellow. <em>l.</em> rigid, dark green. Brazil, 1840.
It forms a compact mass, and requires less heat than the kinds
previously described. It is often confounded with <em>B. pubescens</em>,
from which it may be distinguished by its larger and more loosely
arranged flowers, by its smooth column, by the lip not being
hastate in shape, and by the numerous shallow ridges borne near
the base upon each side. (L. S. O. 2.)</p></blockquote>

<p><a name="CABBAGE" id="CABBAGE"></a><strong>CABBAGE.</strong> The common name for <em>Brassica</em>; but
especially applied to the plain-leaved hearting garden
varieties of <em>Brassica oleracea</em>. To obtain good tender
Cabbages in early spring and throughout the summer, it
is necessary that they should be planted on rich, deeply-trenched
ground, in a position free from the shade of fruit
or other trees. Stable dung or good farmyard manure is
best for this crop, and should be applied when trenching
is being done, burying the manure a spit below the surface.
Cabbages should not be planted successionally on the same
ground, nor should they follow any of the other species
of <em>Brassica</em>, if it can be avoided. A warmer position, not
too much sheltered to make the plants tender, will be
found beneficial for the earliest spring crop. This should
not be planted too soon in autumn, as the plants are more
subject to run to seed, especially if the winter be mild.
The several forms of Cabbage are well known, being so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
much cultivated by cottagers as well as gardeners. None
of those forming close hearts will bear severe frost, but
the Savoys are improved by a little in the early autumn.
The Coleworts are very useful in winter, being perhaps the
hardiest of all; and, as the hearts do not get so close and
hard as the Savoy and other Cabbages, the frost, unless it
is very severe, does not injure them so much.</p>

<p><em>Cultivation.</em> The crop obtained in April and May is
usually the most important one, young Cabbages being
then much appreciated by everyone. The time for seed-sowing
varies in different localities, from the third week in
July to the middle of August. The first date would probably
prove suitable for the northern parts of the country;
and the latter would be early enough for the south. The
seed should be sown thinly in beds of rather light, well
pulverised soil, afterwards covering these with netting,
to protect the seed from birds. The plants will be ready,
in most cases, for placing out during September, or as soon
as the ground can be cleared of other crops and prepared
for their reception. The Early Battersea, or one of its
many allied sorts, is best for sowing at this season; and,
when planting out, an allowance of 2ft. apart each way will
be sufficient. Seed should again be sown on a mild hotbed
in February, and occasionally afterwards, for succession;
and a second crop may be obtained from the plants put out
in autumn if they are allowed to remain. Drumhead and
other strong-growing sorts, sown in spring, will require
from 6in. to 1ft. more space when planted out. These are
not, however, of such good quality as the smaller-growing
varieties.</p>

<p><em>Savoys.</em> The seed of these should be sown in March or
April, according to the locality, in the same way as
described above, in seed beds; and the after treatment is
also very similar. The young plants must not be allowed
to starve in the seed bed, but should be kept watered, and
planted out in June and July, choosing dull weather for
the operation. The ground should occasionally be hoed
between the plants, to keep the surface open and destroy
weeds. Distances of from 15in. to 30in. between the plants,
according to the variety, must be allowed. See Fig. 305.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Coleworts.</em> Seed of these should be sown about the end
of June, and planted out 1ft. apart on a sheltered border,
when large enough. Rosette is one of the best varieties;
but the early Cabbages are often grown and used as Coleworts
before they have had time to form close hearts.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Pickling Cabbage.</em> The Red Dutch is the variety
generally grown for pickling, and is probably the best to
keep its colour when so treated. Seed should be sown in
August, to stand the winter, and again in February for a
succession; only a few plants will, in the majority of cases,
be required, as, if liberally treated, they grow to a good size.</p>

<p><em>Sorts of White Cabbage.</em> These are extremely numerous,
and selections or improved forms are of annual appearance.
Some of the old types are, however, still much cultivated.
The following are a selection of the best sorts for general
purposes: Atkins' Matchless, Carter's Heartwell, Early
Battersea, Early York (see Fig. 306), Ellam's Early Dwarf,
Enfield Market, Little Pixie, Oxheart (see Fig. 307), St.
John's Day (see Fig. 308), Sugarloaf, Wheeler's Imperial,
and Portugal or Couve Tronchuda. The last-named variety
was introduced from Portugal some years ago, where it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
much grown. It has a large midrib, and does not form
very close hearts. It is very tender when cooked, and is
only suitable for culture in summer. Under the name of
Gilbert's Cabbage Broccoli, or Chou de Burghley, a variety
of Cabbage was recently distributed which produces, if
left long enough, hearts resembling Broccoli. Although
there are different opinions as to its merits, it is said to
be very tender when cooked, and is considered a decided
acquisition.</p>

<p>Of Savoys, the best are: Drumhead, Dwarf Green Curled,
Early Ulm, Large Late Green, and Tom Thumb.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Insects, &amp;c.</em> The majority of the Cabbage tribe is
attacked by a very large number of different caterpillars
and other pests, both above and below ground. The plants
in their young stages are always a prey for snails and slugs,
and often require a dusting of soot and lime as a protection.
When planting out, many of the plants are often found
with a protuberance at the root, caused by an insect, and
termed "clubbing." Those so injured should be thrown
away if they can possibly be spared, and the others dipped
in a thick solution of soot water. This is the worst kind
of disease the Cabbage tribe is subject to. The caterpillars
of several moths and butterflies are very destructive in
summer, often eating through the hearts of Cabbages and
Cauliflowers, and so rendering them totally unfit for use.
Hand-picking, or dusting with lime, is apparently the only
means of diminishing the numbers of these pests.</p>

<p><a name="CABBAGE_CATERPILLARS" id="CABBAGE_CATERPILLARS"></a><strong>CABBAGE CATERPILLARS.</strong> <em>Large Cabbage
White</em> (<em>Pieris brassic√¶</em>). From May to July, and again in
September and October, this, the most common of our
butterflies, may be seen in great numbers, frequenting
gardens, lanes, and fields, being especially numerous where
Cabbages are growing. Their beautiful yellow eggs are
laid singly on the under surface of the leaves, and
securely fastened by a natural glue; from these, in due
time, issue the small, but destructive, "green caterpillars."
Shortly after birth, they become quite green in front and
yellow behind. They then get hairy and dotted over with
black; they have eight pairs of feet, of which the three
front ones only are "true" legs, or those which ultimately
develop into the legs of the butterfly. They change their
skin several times, and at each moult become larger in
size. When full grown, they are about 1¬Ωin. long, of a
light green or bluish hue above, and yellow beneath; along
the back of the adult caterpillar is a conspicuous yellow
line, edged on each side with black dots.</p>

<p>The perfect male insect has the body black and wings
white on the upper side, except the tips of the fore-wings,
which are black and crescent-shaped; and on the upper
edge of the hinder wings there is a black spot. On the
under side, the fore wings are white with yellow tips,
and two black patches on each; the hind wings are
yellow, with small black markings. The antenn√¶ are
alternately black and yellow, with the club black above
and yellow beneath. The female (see Fig. 310) differs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
from the male in having two large black spots on each of
the fore or upper wings, and a spot on the inner margin.</p>

<p><em>The Small White</em> (<em>Pieris rap√¶</em>, see Fig. 311) has two
broods in the year, the first batch about April, and the
second in July. The eggs are always placed on the upper
side of the leaf, and are hatched in from ten to thirteen
days, the caterpillars becoming full grown in about three
weeks after emerging. The colour of the caterpillar is
dark green, with a fine line of yellow, and a row of yellow
spots down the sides. The chrysalis is attached by the
tail and a band of silk to the place selected by the caterpillar,
and varies greatly in colour, although generally it is
of a whitish-brown.</p>

<p><em>Cabbage Moth</em> (<em>Mamestra brassic√¶</em>). Newman, in his
"British Moths," thus describes the Cabbage Moth: "The
antenn√¶ are rather long and slender, and scarcely ciliated
in either sex; the fore-wings are dark, smoky, grey brown,
mottled and marbled with confused markings, both darker
and paler; the orbicular spot is inconspicuous, but decidedly
to be traced; the reniform stigma is delicately outlined with
white or whitish-grey, and has a pale anterior disc, in which
the same pale grey colour predominates; the hind wings
are dark, smoky brown with rather pale base, and rather
darker crescentic discoidal spot and wing-rays; the head,
thorax, and body have the same colour as the fore and hind
wings." The eggs are laid on Cabbages, or similar plants,
and are hatched in a few days. The caterpillars are very
voracious, feeding by day and night, and, what is worse,
they spoil with their excrement, in the case of Cabbages,
more than they eat. They are of a dark colour, with a
kind of marbling, more or less distinct, on the back, the
effect being produced by a triangular mark containing two
white dots on each of their segments. On being disturbed,
they roll themselves into a tight ring, and so remain until
they suppose that danger is over. They descend into the
earth for change to smooth red-brown chrysalids, and
remain there till the following spring. If the chrysalids
were collected and destroyed during the autumn and winter
digging, much injury would be obviated through the succeeding
spring and summer.</p>

<p>The destruction of these pests is a very troublesome
matter, as the grubs of the last-named kind bore into the
heart of the cabbage. Hand-picking is the only sure
method. Anything emitting a distasteful odour will also
keep them at bay. Miss Ormerod recommends throwing
gas-lime over the plants, but it must be previously weakened
by a few months' exposure. The following remedy
may also be recommended:</p>

<p><em>Paraffin</em>, or <em>Coal Oil</em>. Mix one ounce of oil with a
gallon of soapsuds, and water the plants with the mixture
before the caterpillars appear. If any have appeared, an
application at the rate of two ounces to the gallon will
generally clear them off. Of course, this operation must
not be performed less than a month previous to cutting the
cabbages, on account of the smell. Soapsuds alone will
also clear caterpillars from most smooth-leaved subjects if
frequently applied.</p>

<p><a name="CABBAGE_FLY" id="CABBAGE_FLY"></a><strong>CABBAGE FLY</strong> (<em>Anthomyia brassic√¶</em>). Among the
injurious insects which infest Cabbages, none commit
greater havoc to both stem and root, than the maggots of
the Cabbage Fly. "They are whitish, cylindrical, and
legless, tapering to the head, and blunt at the tail, which
has short teeth on the lower margin, and two brown
tubercles in the middle. When full grown, they are about
‚Öìin. long. They then leave the plants, and turn, in the
earth, to pup√¶, with a few black spots at the head, and
short teeth at the tail, inside which the flies form, and
emerge in about a fortnight or three weeks. The fly is
of an ashen-grey colour, and smaller than the Onion Fly,
which it much resembles. The male is of a darker grey,
and has a short black stripe along the back between the
wings, with a curved one on each side of it, and one black
stripe along the abdomen" (Ormerod). The presence of
these maggots may be easily detected by the flagging and
change of colour of the leaves. The infested plants should
be immediately removed and destroyed. The following
remedy will be found beneficial:</p>

<p><em>Lime.</em> Hot lime should be soaked in water for about
twenty-four hours. When clear, the infested Cabbages
should be well washed with the liquid. Superphosphate
of lime may also be applied with advantage.</p>

<p><a name="CABBAGE_GALL_WEEVIL" id="CABBAGE_GALL_WEEVIL"></a><strong>CABBAGE GALL WEEVIL</strong> (<em>Ceutorrhynchus sulcicollis</em>).
This is a pretty little beetle, about three-quarters
of a line or one line in length. Its colour is dark, but the
insect is really of a coppery hue; on the thorax and head
are rather large depressions; the wing-cases vary in colour
from green to greenish-blue, or even black, and along the
entire length of the elytra are parallel lines or holes, as
may be seen with the aid of an ordinary lens. This insect,
which causes much damage to plants of the <em>Brassica</em> family,
is, in some places, very difficult to eradicate. It is also
very destructive to other crops, and, therefore, any
effectual remedy is valuable. The following methods may
be recommended:</p>

<p><em>Carbolic Acid.</em> Mix 1oz. Calvert's No. 5 carbolic acid
with two gallons of soapsuds, and add sufficient loam or
clay to make a thin paste. Dip the roots of the whole of
the plants into this before they are set out. Well stir
the mixture, and put the plants out in a damp soil, so
that watering will not be necessary.</p>

<p><em>Paraffin</em>, or <em>Coal Oil</em>. This, applied in the same manner
as recommended for Carbolic Acid, is also very good.</p>

<p><em>Guano, Superphosphate of Lime, and Nitrate of Soda.</em>
A good dressing of either of these, given after the ground
is dug, and in wet weather, about a month before the
plants are put out, has been found very beneficial; but,
although preventatives, they do not totally clear the crop
from insects for the season.</p>

<p><em>Soot and Lime.</em> Take equal parts of air-slaked lime
and soot, and mix together. Set the plants with a trowel,
and, having placed some soil over the roots, throw in a
little of the mixture, filling up the hole with soil.</p>

<p><a name="CABBAGE_POWDERED-WING" id="CABBAGE_POWDERED-WING"></a><strong>CABBAGE POWDERED-WING</strong> (<em>Aleyrodes brassic√¶</em>).
A small four-winged powdery fly, closely allied to
the Aphides. As implied by its name, this pest infests the
various sorts of Cabbages. It is more particularly prevalent
in autumn. Its presence may be readily detected by
the partial discoloration of the leaves attacked. The head
and body between the wings are black, with yellow variegation;
abdomen yellow or rosy; wings white and mealy
(whence its common name), the upper pair each having
a darker spot, near the centre. Its destructive power
resides in the rostrum, or sucking-tube, with which its head
is furnished.</p>

<p><em>Remedies.</em> The only effectual means of exterminating
this pest is to destroy the leaves, preferably by burning.
If its presence is detected early, an application of tobacco
water, or diluted soft soap, may prove beneficial.</p>

two-edged, or leafy stems. Flowers very variable, showy
or minute, usually solitary, sessile, rarely in fascicles, ephemeral;
petals disposed in two or more series, hardly
distinguishable from the inner sepals, and sometimes united
with them; sepals numerous, united and adnate a great
length to the ovarium. Fruit fleshy, one-celled, many-seeded.
Well-known genera are <em>Cereus</em>, <em>Melocactus</em>,

<p><a name="CACTUS" id="CACTUS"></a><strong>CACTUS</strong> (from <em>kaktos</em>, a name used by Theophrastus
to describe a spiny plant). This generic term is popularly
applied to all members of the extensive family <em>Cacte√¶</em>,
which order may be distinguished by the following
characteristics: Calyx composed of many sepals, usually
indefinite in number, the inner series not readily distinguishable
from the petals, united and adnate a great
length to the ovary; with the tube smooth in the genera
<em>Mammillaria</em>, <em>Melocactus</em>, and <em>Rhipsalis</em>; or with the lobes
of the sepals crowning the fruit, and having the tube scaly,
as in the genera <em>Cereus</em>, <em>Opuntia</em>, and <em>Pereskia</em>. Petals
disposed in two or more series, hardly distinguishable from
the inner sepals, and somewhat united to them; sometimes
irregular, and disposed in a long tube at the base, but
distinct at the apex, as in the genera <em>Mammillaria</em>, <em>Melocactus</em>,
and <em>Cereus</em>; sometimes equal and distinct to the
very base, forming a rotate corolla, as in the genera
<em>Opuntia</em>, <em>Pereskia</em>, and <em>Rhipsalis</em>. Stamens indefinite,
disposed in many series, more or less cohering with the
petals or inner sepals; filaments slender, filiform; anthers
ovate, versatile, two-celled. Ovarium obovate, fleshy, one-celled.
Fruit fleshy, one-celled, many seeded, either smooth
and crowned by the calyx, or covered with scales, scars, or
tubercles, and umbilicate at the apex. This order contains
fleshy or succulent shrubs, very variable in habit and size.
Flowers very variable, showy, or minute, usually solitary,
sessile, rarely in fascicles, ephemeral, expanding by night
or day. Leaves usually wanting, but, when present, small,
caducous, and terete, rarely flat and expanded, sometimes
alternate and disposed in a spiral order, always glabrous
and fleshy. Prickles or bristles disposed in fascicles, rising
from the axils of the leaves. In the leafless genera, the
fascicles of spines are disposed on the angles of the stem,
rising from tubercles. Stems usually angular, winged, or
regularly beset with tubercles, rarely terete, usually jointed;
joints compressed. A group of Cacti is shown at Fig. 312,
for which we are indebted to Herr Fr. Ad. Haage, jun., of

<p><em>Cultivation.</em> Perhaps no class of plants more easily
accommodate themselves to a general system of treatment,
than do these; although certain genera would undoubtedly
thrive better than when subjected to the lower temperature,
suited to the requirements of those coming from cooler
regions. Notwithstanding that nearly all the species are
natives of the western hemisphere, they occur in various
geographical and altitudinal areas, in which the temperature
is proportionately lessened or increased, as the case
may be; yet, presuming a special house is set apart for
their culture, the majority of the species may be happily
suited therein. The warmest end of the structure should
be selected for the tropical kinds; while those found in
cooler regions may be grown in the other portions of
the house; even those which are hardy in our climate
are really best wintered in a house or frame. Granted
that several species will endure our winter outside, it is
yet necessary to give them the shelter of a friendly ledge of
the rockery, or frame, or to cover them in their permanent
position with a hand light, or sheet of glass, in order to
prevent the ill-effects of excessive moisture. Generally, a
winter temperature of from 50deg. to 55deg., and a summer
one of from 70deg. to 80deg. during shade, or in sunshine
up to 90deg., will be found advantageous. When thus
treated, it will be necessary to keep the tropical species,
on the whole, very dry during the winter. As regards
soil, potting, and general treatment, all may be treated
alike, except <em>Epiphyllum</em>, <em>Disocactus</em>, and <em>Pereskia</em> (which
<em>see</em>). Some growers give them the protection of a house
in winter, and stand them outside during the summer,
which is not, however, a very commendable plan, as, in
consequence of the very variable character of our climate
being especially prejudicial to several of the tender and
more delicate species, the often excessive amount of
moisture they would receive, will produce a weakly state
of health in many, while others will be lost. It is far
better if their culture is attempted at all, to give them the
proper treatment. The numerous species and varieties
found on the Rocky Mountains are a most interesting
series, and may be well managed in a cold frame facing
south, arranging them on shelves as close to the glass as
possible, and keeping them very dry through the winter.
If the weather is very severe, the lights should be matted.
One of the best collections of these in the country, is in
the possession of E. G. Loder, Esq., Floore House, Weedon,
Northampton, where a great number are admirably grown
in frames, and under a large ledge of the rockery outside.
Amateurs may grow quantities of handsome Cacti either
in dwelling rooms near the window, or in small frames
or greenhouses. As they are slow growing, not much
space will be occupied; at the same time, a great deal
of interest will be centred in their culture. As regards
watering and insect pests, they are but little trouble.
Miniature Cacti, of numerous kinds, are now often sold in
small pots, and most attractive little subjects they prove.</p>

<p><em>Soil, Drainage, and Potting.</em> Good ordinary fibrous loam
should form about one-half of the compost, the other half
should be made up of sand, broken bricks, and lime rubbish
in equal quantities; the whole to be carefully mixed together,
and not used until it is moderately dry. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
absolutely necessary to ensure perfect drainage; a good
"stopper" should, therefore, be placed over the hole at the
bottom of the pot, and about one-third of its depth filled
with draining material. The best time for potting is during
February and March. Turn out the plants, and remove
nearly all the old soil from the roots, taking away any dead
or decaying roots which may be observable. Place some of
the roughest soil next the crocks, and gradually fill the pots
with the finer material, well working the same amongst the
roots; finally press the soil moderately firm. Do not water
for a few days after potting, but syringe every evening,
especially if the weather be fine; a little extra heat may
be given after potting, to excite new, healthy growth. It
will not be necessary every year to repot specimens in large
vessels. A good top-dressing, with an occasional dose of
weak liquid manure, is all they will require for several
seasons.</p>

<p><em>Watering.</em> This must be discriminately managed, especially
during the winter; for, whatever their treatment
as regards temperature during that season, they must be
studiously watered, and anything like a saturated condition
of the soil should be avoided. If the temperature is
brisk, a little water may be given once a week, or perhaps
not quite so often. If the plants are subjected to very
cool treatment, water must be sparingly administered
during November, December, and January; after which,
they should be examined weekly, and very carefully attended
to. During the summer months, when in active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
growth, they will not suffer if watered twice a week;
and, on bright afternoons, light syringings may be advantageously
given.</p>

<p><em>Propagation.</em> Three methods are adopted, viz., by cuttings
or offsets, grafting, and seeds; the former is the plan
generally adopted. The cuttings or offsets should be
removed with a sharp cut, and laid upon a sunny shelf
until the wound is healed and roots are emitted, when they
should be potted in sandy soil, and placed with the others.
They will thrive freely if kept syringed. Grafting is resorted
to with delicate kinds, which, from some reason or
another, will not grow freely except upon the stock of a
stronger species; and, by this means also, such delicate
kinds can be kept from the damp soil, which frequently
causes incipient decay. The stocks usually employed are
those of <em>Cereus tortuosus</em>, <em>C. peruvianus</em>, &amp;c., according to
the species intended for working; they readily unite with
each other. If the scion and stock are both slender, wedge-grafting
should be adopted; if both are broad, it is best
to make horizontal sections, placing them together and
securing in proper position by tying with matting, but not
too tightly, or the surface may be injured. Propagation by
seeds is not often adopted, as it is a very slow method;
they should be sown in very sandy soil, and placed in a
semi-shady position until germination commences, when
they may be exposed, and very carefully watered.</p>

<p><a name="CALADIUM" id="CALADIUM"></a><strong>CALADIUM</strong> (derivation of name doubtful; probably
of Indian origin). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Aroide√¶</em>. Stove perennials, chiefly
grown for the great beauty and varied hue of their leaves.
Spathe hood-like, rolled round at the base; spadix, upper
portion entirely covered with stamens, but ultimately
becoming bare at the extreme top, provided with blunt
glands or sterile stamens in the middle, and ovaries
beneath; anthers shield-shaped and one-celled; ovaries
numerous, two-celled, with from two to four ascending
ovules in each cell. Leaves upon long petioles, more or
less sagittate, ovate, and usually very richly coloured.
Fruit a one or two-celled berry, with few seeds. They
are all of easy culture, and grow freely in a humid
atmosphere. In March, when the tubers have been kept
dry or rested for some time, they may be started into
growth again, in small pots, placed in a stove or pit,
where a night temperature of from 60deg. to 65deg. is
maintained, and syringed daily once or twice at least.
As soon as indications of activity are presented, they
may be shifted into 4in., 5in., or 6in. pots, or larger ones
may be used if good sized specimens are required. If
the tubers should be in large pots, it is best to turn
them out, dividing if necessary, and placing all the crowns
in small pots, from which they can be removed when root
action and growth are resumed, and they require more
room. Large tubers, if sound, may be divided, and the
pieces placed in pots of such sizes as it is desired to grow
them in.</p>

<p><em>Soil.</em> Turfy loam, leaf mould, turfy peat, and a little well
decomposed manure, in equal parts (not broken up too fine),
with a good sprinkling of sharp sand, form an excellent
compost, the whole being well incorporated together.
Thorough drainage must be insured, as these plants require
an abundance of water. After potting, they should be
placed in a stove temperature, and kept well moistened
by syringing two or three times daily. If accommodated
with mild bottom heat at this time, they will make much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
freer and more vigorous growth than if otherwise treated.
Water sparingly at first, but as soon as the leaves expand,
increase the supply; and, when the pots are well filled with
roots, apply clear liquid manure at every other time of
watering. As the season advances, the temperature and
humidity of the house should be increased. During bright
sunshine, Caladiums should be slightly shaded for a few
hours in the middle of the day, with some thin material,
just to break the fierceness of the sun's rays; but the more
they are exposed to the light at other times during growth,
the brighter, richer, and more beautiful will the foliage
be. As soon as the plants have attained a good size,
some of them should be placed in the coolest part of the
house, and partially hardened off; they may then be taken
to the conservatory, allowing them a situation free from
currents of cold air, and giving water only when really
necessary. They may remain here for some time, but
care must be taken to return them to the stove before
they suffer from cold.</p>

<p>Small neatly grown specimens make beautiful ornaments
for table decoration, and their suitability for exhibition
purposes is well known, and largely taken advantage
of. Towards autumn, and as the foliage begins to fade, the
supply of water should be gradually lessened, until all the
leaves die down; the pots should then be placed under the
stage in the stove, where they can be looked to now and
then, and a little water given if required. By no means
allow the tubers to get dried up, as is often done; for, if
so, they will frequently rot away inside; whereas, kept in
a semi-moist condition, even the most delicate can be preserved.
In this state, they may remain until the following
season. Caladiums will not endure a very low temperature;
from 55deg. to 60deg. is as low as they can be
safely kept. Very few of those known as "true species"
are grown, being superseded, for general decorative purposes,
by the numerous hybrids which have been raised of
late, principally from <em>C. bicolor</em>.</p>

<p><a name="CALAMUS" id="CALAMUS"></a><strong>CALAMUS</strong> (from <em>kalamos</em>, a reed; old Greek name
used by Theophrastus). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Palme√¶</em>. An elegant genus of
stove palms. Flowers small, usually of a rose or greenish
colour, clustered upon branching spikes, each branch
having a separate spathe, which is not large enough to
enclose it. Fruit one-seeded, and covered with smooth,
shining scales. Leaves pinnate. Stems reed-like, 1in. to
2in. in thickness. When in a young state, these palms
are most effective as drawing or diningroom decorations;
and, when in a more mature condition, they are excellent
as stove ornaments and for exhibition purposes. They
are all of slender growth, and of easy culture in a compost
of equal parts loam and vegetable mould; a copious supply
of water being needed to keep them in a flourishing state.
Propagated by seeds. <em>C. Rotang</em>, <em>C. viminalis</em>, and several
other species furnish the canes usually employed in this
country for the bottoms of chairs, couches, &amp;c.</p>

Italian botanist, who lived in the beginning of the
eighteenth century). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Portulace√¶</em>. A rather large
genus of fleshy, glabrous, annual or perennial, herbaceous
plants, some fourteen or fifteen species growing in Australia,
the rest occurring in the New World. Flowers usually
rose or purple, solitary, or in terminal umbels or racemes.
Leaves quite entire, radical or alternate. Only four or five
species are cultivated in this country; these are treated
as half-hardy annuals&mdash;with the exception of <em>C. umbellata</em>,
which is best treated as a biennial&mdash;and as such they are
extensively grown in small gardens, with most satisfactory
results. They should be sown in the spots where they are
intended to flower, as transplantation, unless performed
with more than ordinary care, will considerably check their
growth or result in loss. Their flowers only expand
during bright sunshine, and, consequently, they are less
grown than they otherwise would be. The plants thrive in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
a light sandy soil. <em>C. umbellata</em> may be sown in a pan,
placed in a cold frame, in May or June; and when the
plants are large enough to handle, they should be potted
off, or placed out in colonies where they are to bloom.</p>

<p><a name="CALANTHE" id="CALANTHE"></a><strong>CALANTHE</strong> (from <em>kalos</em>, beautiful, and <em>anthos</em>, a
flower). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Orchide√¶</em>. S<span class="smcapa">EC</span>. <em>Vand√¶</em>. A very handsome
genus of stove terrestrial orchids. They may be characterised
as robust-growing plants, producing large,
broad, many-ribbed, or plaited leaves, which are, with one
or two exceptions, evergreen, and long spikes, bearing
many flowers, distinguished by their calcarate lip, which is
attached to the column, and by the eight thick, waxy pollen
masses adhering to a separate gland. Calanthes should
be special favourites with amateurs, as, in the first place,
they produce an abundance of showy flowers, which last a
long time in perfection; and, secondly, because they are
so easily managed. In potting these plants, it will be
necessary to depart from the usual style of potting orchids,
and, instead of elevating them above the rim of the pot
upon a cone of peat and sphagnum, they must be kept
below the rim, as in potting ordinary plants. In place
of the usual soil and moss, these plants should have a
mixture of loam, leaf mould, and peat, broken up rough,
to which may be added some silver sand and dried cow
manure. During the growing season, they require abundant
supply of water, and in winter even this element must be
administered freely to the evergreen kinds; whilst the
deciduous ones, on the contrary, enjoy a thorough rest after
blooming. Good drainage is essential to all. Little more
need be said upon the cultivation of Calanthes during
the summer months. When growing, they enjoy strong
heat and plenty of moisture; but, when growth is complete,
a cooler situation is most beneficial. They are subject to
the attacks of various insects, which must be continually
searched for, and, when found, destroyed; for, if neglected
in this particular, the bold and handsome leaves will be
much disfigured, and rendered far from ornamental. Propagated
by suckers and divisions. About forty species are
known, of which the following are a selection:</p>

<p><a name="CALATHEA" id="CALATHEA"></a><strong>CALATHEA</strong> (from <em>kalathos</em>, a basket; in reference
to the basket-shaped stigma, or to the leaves being worked
into baskets in South America). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Scitamine√¶</em>. This
genus of very ornamental-leaved stove plants is distinguished
from <em>Maranta</em> by mere botanical characters;
and the two genera are often confounded. Flowers in terminal
spikes, bracteate; perianth six-cleft, outer segments
lanceolate, inner ones blunt and irregular; stamens three,
petal-like. Leaves large, springing from the contracted
stem, near the root. They delight in a rich, loose, open
soil, consisting of peat, loam, and leaf soil, in about
equal proportions, with the addition of a good sprinkling
of sand, to keep it open and porous. The mixture should
be used in a rough, lumpy state, so that the roots,
which are of large size, may be able to travel with freedom.
Nearly all the species admit of easy increase by
division. July is a favourable time to set about it, or it
may be carried out any time between that and the spring
months. In order to make the necessary separation without
damaging the roots, the plants should be shaken out
from the soil, when they may be divided into as many
pieces as there are separate crowns. Whether an increased
stock be desired or not, Calatheas require fresh soil
annually; and, if not reduced by division, they become
much too thickly foliaged to properly develop, unless
they are shifted into larger-sized pots, which can always
be done if large specimens are required. When making
divisions, see that each crown is well furnished with roots,
so that they may at once commence sending up fresh
young foliage. Although Calatheas require an abundant
supply of water while growing, a stagnant moisture is most
injurious; good drainage is, therefore, essential. To have
the leaves in fine, healthy condition, plenty of atmospheric
moisture must be maintained during their growth; and, if
syringing is resorted to for the purpose of securing this,
clear soft water should be used, or an unsightly deposit will
be the result, by which the beauty of the plants, unless they
are frequently sponged, will be spoiled. These plants require,
in addition to plenty of moisture, moderate shade
during the summer, as they dislike strong sunshine, and
may, therefore, be grown among ferns, under creepers, in
situations that would be of little use for other purposes.
Calatheas are not subject to insects if properly supplied
with water while growing, and a sufficiently moist atmosphere
is at all times maintained; but, if either of these
are lacking, red spider soon put in an appearance, and
quickly disfigure the leaves.</p>

<p>S<span class="smcapa">HRUBBY</span> S<span class="smcapa">ECTION</span>. In addition to the widely-known
utility of this class for bedding purposes, they are fine
decorative plants when well grown, and useful alike in
conservatory or dwelling house. It will be found more
convenient to grow these in a pit or frame, as in such
places they are less liable to the attacks of fly, and make
sturdier growth. If large plants are required, cuttings
should be taken in August, placed in a cold frame facing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the north, in sandy soil, and, when rooted, potted off
into 3in. pots. They should then be placed in a light
sunny frame, where they may remain until the middle of
February. The points should then be pinched out. When
the plants break, they must be shifted into 48-sized pots.
If there are from four to six breaks to each plant, it
will be sufficient; but, should such not be the case, the
plants must be stopped again, when the requisite number
will probably be obtained. Directly the roots touch the
pots, the plants should be transferred to 7in. or 8in. pots,
in which they will flower, and the shoots must be tied
out so as to develop fully. Every effort should be exerted
to keep the foliage green to the base of the plants, and
they should be fumigated on the first appearance of green
fly. As the flower-spikes are thrown up, weak liquid
manure, applied two or three times a week, will prove
beneficial. For potting, the following compost is most
suitable: One-half good fibrous loam, one-eighth thoroughly
rotted manure, and the remainder leaf soil, with enough
sharp sand to keep the whole open. During frosty weather,
of course, it will be necessary to protect the frames with
mats, and to water judiciously, to avoid damping. Those
plants intended for bedding will not require to be repotted,
but should be inserted, about 3in. apart, in sandy soil, in
a cold frame. The tops must be taken off early in March;
and from the middle of April to the middle of May, they
may be planted out where they are to remain. Should
frosty weather, accompanied by drying winds, ensue, the
plants will require the protection of inverted flower-pots,
with pieces of slate or crock placed over the holes. A good
soil, abundantly enriched with rotten manure, is most
desirable for them.</p>

<p><em>Varieties.</em> These are very numerous. The best of them
are the following: B<span class="smcapa">IJOU</span>, dark red, very free; G<span class="smcapa">AINE'S</span>
Y<span class="smcapa">ELLOW</span>, rich deep yellow, extremely free; G<span class="smcapa">ENERAL</span>

<p>H<span class="smcapa">ERBACEOUS</span> S<span class="smcapa">ECTION</span>. These, like the preceding, are
very useful, both for house and conservatory decoration
(see Fig. 321). A packet of seed from a first-class firm will,
if properly managed, produce a good percentage of excellent
flowers. The seed may be sown from June to
August, when large batches are required (when only one
sowing is made, July will be the best month), on pans
of light, sandy soil, which should be soaked with water
before sowing. Care must be taken to make the surface
of the soil level, and also to sow the seed as evenly as
possible. It is better not to cover with soil, but a sheet
of glass should be laid over the pan, which must be
placed in a shady part of the greenhouse or cold frame
until the young plants show the first leaf. The glass
can then be gradually removed. When large enough to
handle, the seedlings must be pricked out, about 2in.
asunder, in pans or boxes, and placed in a close, shaded
situation. As soon as of sufficient size, they must be
placed singly in 3in. pots, returned to the frame, kept close
for a few days, and as near the glass as possible, to make
them sturdy. When necessary, they should be shifted into
5in. pots, in which they may be kept through the winter;
or the later batches may be placed in small pots. By the
end of October or early in November, the plants will be
strong and fit for wintering; at this stage, the best place
for them is in a dry, frost-proof pit, or on an airy shelf of
the greenhouse, giving them sufficient water to prevent
flagging. All dead leaves must be removed. On the first
appearance of green fly, the plants should be fumigated
with tobacco. From the end of January onwards, in order
to encourage growth, the plants should be removed into
7in. or 8in. pots, giving plenty of drainage, and a compost
consisting of one-half good light fibrous loam, one-fourth
thoroughly decayed sheep manure, and one-fourth
leaf soil, to which must be added sufficient coarse sand to
keep the whole open. After potting, the plants must be
again placed in the same position, and, as they require it,
plenty of room given. Careful attention to watering is
necessary, as they must not be allowed to get dry. Air
must be given on all suitable occasions. The flower-stems,
as they require it, should be supported with small neat
sticks. About May, the plants will commence to bloom,
and continue to do so for a couple of months. The best
flowers should be selected, and cross-fertilised with a
camel-hair pencil, in order to produce a good strain of
seed for future sowing. The attention of horticulturists
appears to be almost wholly confined to the innumerable
hybrids raised from <em>amplexicaulis</em>, <em>arachnoidea</em>, <em>corymbosa</em>,
<em>integrifolia</em>, <em>purpurea</em>, <em>thyrsiflora</em>, and a few others. Very
few pure species are seen in cultivation, although most of
them are well worth growing.</p>

localities and sheltered positions, they may be flowered
outside. A frame, in a sunny situation, is the best possible
place for their cultivation. Here they may be
fully exposed to the sun and air, during mild weather,
through the winter; and, when expedient, they may be
protected from excessive moisture, as that is the primary
cause of failure, rather than cold, for they are perfectly
hardy, and capable of enduring all the frost we are likely
to get. From May onwards, the lights might be wholly
removed. From the end of June to August, the bulbs will
be in bloom, when, if necessary, the flowers should be
fertilised to secure seed; and when the capsules are
forming, material assistance would be given by placing the
lights on again, allowing plenty of air. Assuming that
fresh bulbs are being planted, they should be in the soil
early in the autumn, as nothing is more prejudicial
than keeping them dry through the winter. A good depth
of soil should be provided, composed of fibrous loam, leaf
soil, and sand, in equal proportions, in a well-drained
position. The bulbs must be planted 3in. deep, and some
sand placed about them; they may be left undisturbed
for years. Of course, where no frame can be provided,
they may be planted in a well-drained, sunny position in
the same soil. They are also easily managed in pots, but
it is necessary to pot in the autumn, and keep in a frame.
Through the winter, they must never be allowed to get dry,
until the leaves are withering in the autumn, when water
may be withheld.</p>

<p><em>Propagation.</em> This may be effected by seeds or offsets,
and by the tiny bulbs frequently produced on the upper
portion of the stem. Sow seeds in pans, in a cool house or
frame, as soon as ripe, or in the early part of the year, and
keep the plants close to the glass during their early
stages, as they are very liable to damp off. Sow thinly,
so as to enable the young plants to pass a second season in
the seed pots or pans. Early in the third season, pot off
and plant out singly, encouraging them to grow freely.
Propagation by offsets is the most usual method. With
liberal treatment, most of the species increase pretty
freely. The offsets are best removed when the plants are
in a dormant state. They may be either grown in pots or
pans, or planted out in pits or frames, until they reach
flowering size. During the season of rest, it is the safest
plan, with those in pots, to keep them in the earth in
which they were grown.</p>

peat. Young cuttings, thinly dibbled in a pot of sand,
strike root freely under a hand glass, in heat. Care must
be taken that they do not receive an excess of moisture, or
they will rot.</p>

Leaves narrow, about 1ft. long, grooved down the inside.
They thrive best in a sheltered, partially-shaded situation,
but will do fairly well in almost any ordinary good garden
soil. A compost of loam and leaf mould, with a liberal
mixture of sharp sand, suits them best. They need not
be disturbed for several years; but a top-dressing of rich
soil or well-rotted manure may be given yearly. Propagated
by offsets and seeds. The plants are so hardy that
they ripen seeds in warm situations. These may be sown
as soon as ripe, or the following spring, either in a warm
situation out of doors, or in pots or boxes, under glass. The
young plants make rapid progress, and should remain for
at least two years in the seed beds. The best time for
final transplanting is in February. Offsets are produced
very freely, and should be removed either when in a dormant
condition, or just previously to starting into fresh
growth, and arranged in clumps or lines, placing a little
sand about them.</p>

<p><a name="CAMELLIA" id="CAMELLIA"></a><strong>CAMELLIA</strong> (named in honour of George Joseph
Camellus or Kamel, a Moravian Jesuit and traveller in
Asia, who wrote a history of the plants of the Isle of Luzon,
which is inserted in the third vol. of John Ray's "Historia
Plantarum"). Japanese Rose. Including <em>Thea.</em> O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>.
<em>Ternstr≈ìmiace√¶</em>. A genus of elegant hardy or nearly
hardy evergreen shrubs or trees. Flowers large; sepals
five or six, gradually passing from bracts into petals,
the latter slightly cohering at the base; stamens numerous.
Leaves coriaceous. By close attention to a few particulars
in the management of these beautiful plants, much
disappointment may be avoided, and a succession of flowers
obtained from October till the following July. The fact of
the buds frequently dropping off, deters many would-be
growers from attempting the culture of the Camellia. Dryness
of the atmosphere, and want of water at the roots, are
generally the primary causes of failure; the remedy for
these evils rests with the cultivator. The roots are apt to
get matted together, compressing the earth around them
into a hard ball, impervious to water; hence attention is
necessary to see that the water poured into the pot
thoroughly moistens all the soil. In order to form handsome
plants, they should be trained with single stems to
rods, and pruned, so as to make them throw out side
branches from every part of the stem; they must not be
placed too close to each other on the stage, or when planted
out. A liberal supply of water is always necessary, but
especially so during the flowering period. Plants that are
required to flower early may remain in the warm house till
they commence to blossom, when they should be removed
to a cold place, such as the back of a greenhouse, giving
them plenty of light. Those kept in a hothouse or vinery
during summer, will flower in the beginning or middle of
October; and a large plant, having from fifty to one
hundred buds, will continue in flower till the month of
January. Those that are removed early, will blossom in
January, and so succeed the others. The plants that have
finished flowering should be brought back to the hothouse,
where they will begin to make new wood, and be ready to
come in succession next season. By thus shifting the
plants from a warm to a cold situation, a regular succession
will be secured from October to July. The soil
should be kept constantly moist, and in the summer
months the leaves occasionally syringed. Camellias
flower best when kept in small pots or tubs. In order to
raise and exhibit these handsome plants to the best advantage,
they should be grown in a separate house, of
ample height, as they never look so well as when 6ft. or
8ft. high, trained in a conical form, with branches from
the root upwards; and the plants should be raised near to
the glass on a movable stage, which should be lowered as
they grow. In summer, they may either be placed in the
open air in a sheltered spot, or the glass roof of the house
can be taken off. The hardier sorts, such as the Double-red,
Blush, and P√¶ony-flowered, succeed in the bed or
border of a conservatory, if the roof can be taken off in
summer, so as to admit air. If this cannot be managed,
they are better grown in portable pots or boxes. The most
suitable time for shifting Camellias is directly after flowering;
they should then be put into a vinery or hothouse,
where there is a little heat; or the warmest part of a greenhouse.
They will soon begin to make new wood, where
they should be allowed to remain, amply supplied with
water, till they form their flower buds, at the extremity and
sides of the young growth. A few should then be removed
to a cold place, and shaded during strong sunshine. In a
few weeks afterwards, others may also be transferred, so
as to have a regular succession of flowering plants.</p>

<p><em>Propagation.</em> The red Camellias are generally propagated
by layers, but cuttings will also succeed; the single
red Camellia being raised by either cuttings, layers, or
seeds. This latter forms suitable stocks on which to inarch
or graft the rarer kinds. The ripened shoots of the preceding
summer should be taken off in August, cutting them
smoothly at a joint or bud. Two or three of the lower
leaves should be taken off, and the cuttings planted firmly
in the soil with a dibble. Some growers use peat earth and
sand to strike in, while others prefer a loam mixed with
sand and peat. The pans containing the cuttings should be
kept in a plant or cold frame, without being covered with
glasses, but shaded during powerful sunshine. In the
following spring, such as have struck will begin to push,
when they need to be placed in a gentle heat. The following
September or October, the rooted plants will be fit
to pot off, and in the second or third spring they may be
used as stocks. Inarching or grafting is done in early
spring, as soon as growth commences. When this process
is completed, care must be taken to fix the pot containing
the stock so that it may not be disturbed during the connection
of the scion with the parent plant. The grafting
being clayed over, is then covered with moss, to prevent its
cracking. When independent grafting is resorted to, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
mode called "side grafting" is generally employed, as in
the case of Orange-trees; but the operation of tongueing is
generally omitted, as tending to weaken the stock. Liquid
or other manure is not required; nor is it desirable to apply
it, as it often, sooner or later, causes the destruction of
the plants. As a rule, insects do not trouble this class of
plants; but scale will sometimes appear, and can easily be
removed by hand. Thrips occasionally put in an appearance,
but a little smoke will quickly get rid of them.</p>

<p><a name="CAMPANULA" id="CAMPANULA"></a><strong>CAMPANULA</strong> (diminutive of <em>campana</em>, a bell; in reference
to the shape of the flowers). Bell-flower; Slipperwort.
O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Campanulace√¶</em>. A genus of mostly perennial&mdash;rarely
annual or biennial&mdash;herbs. Flowers blue or white, for the
most part pedunculate, usually racemose, rarely spicate or
glomerate. Radical leaves usually different in form from
the cauline ones, especially in size. All the species of this
genus are elegant when in flower (see Fig. 339), and are
very largely grown. The dwarf varieties make excellent
subjects for pot culture, rockeries, or the fronts of borders.
A rather rich sandy loam, with plenty of drainage, suits
these plants. The forms of <em>C. pyramidalis</em> may be kept
in cold frames during the winter, and firmly repotted in
summer, the crown of the plant being kept just a trifle
raised above the soil, or they are at times liable to damp
off, through the water lodging around the necks. During
hot weather, the pots should be plunged in a bed of ashes.
Campanulas are easily raised from seeds, which should
be sown in spring.</p>

<p><em>General Culture.</em> As a rule, few plants are so easily
cultivated as these. The strong-growing kinds may be
grown with the greatest success in ordinary garden soil,
well enriched with manure, while the alpine kinds are
easily managed on the rockery. Sow seeds of the annuals
in April, and of the biennials in June, in the open, or in a
cold frame. The perennials are chiefly propagated by
dividing the roots, or by young cuttings, in spring&mdash;the
latter is by far the best method of propagation with many
of the species&mdash;or by seeds. Those kinds requiring special
treatment are particularised, and those suitable to the
rockery are so designated. Perennials, except where otherwise
mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="CANKER" id="CANKER"></a><strong>CANKER.</strong> This is a disease presenting very serious
difficulties, principally in the cultivation of Apples and
Pears. Both the trees and fruits, especially of some
varieties, are, in many localities, so far injured as not to
be worth cultivating. What causes the disease is not at
all times known; indeed, it is, in most cases, but imperfectly
understood. Were the causes better known, the
remedy might generally be much easier found. Some of
the primary causes are cold and undrained soil, severe
and careless pruning, extreme variations of temperature,
and excessive growth, made late in the season, when it
has not sufficient time to get well ripened. Trees that
are badly Cankered may often be improved by lifting, and
replanting in improved or better-drained soil. Immediately
the disease is detected in young trees, by the cracking of
the bark or the skin of the fruits, measures should be
taken to find the cause, if possible, and avert its progress.
Some Pear-trees, in various localities, will not produce
fruit without Canker in the open garden, but they will do
so when planted against a wall; and as such may be the
very best varieties, trees should be placed in the latter
position. The removal of large branches, late in spring,
will sometimes produce Canker, at the point where mutilation
has taken place; and it may be caused by severe
late pruning, which induces the growth of soft shoots that
are almost certain to be injured by severe frosts. The difference
in the seasons, as regards the amount of moisture,
is one that can scarcely be provided against. One spring
may be favourable to rapid growth, and the following may
be most unfavourable, thereby arresting the natural flow
of the sap until the latter part of the summer, when
excessive growth will probably take place. Such checks
invariably produce Canker. At times, the disease seems
caused by the punctures of insects, in an early stage,
on the stems or branches. In such instances, a thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
cleansing, and a smearing of quicklime, made into a wash,
often proves successful. Strong tobacco water will destroy
insects, and a weak solution of sulphuric acid is also fatal
to lichens and mosses, which should never be allowed to
obtain a footing. The chief preventatives, therefore, are:
Planting in well-drained soil; avoiding the use of any
rank manure, to cause excessive growth; changing the
old, or adding new, soil to injured trees; careful pruning,
and the encouragement of early growth in spring, and
subsequent well ripening in autumn.</p>

<p><a name="CANNA" id="CANNA"></a><strong>CANNA</strong> (derivation uncertain; according to some, from
<em>cana</em>, the Celtic name for cane, or reed). Indian Shot.
O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Scitamine√¶</em>. A large genus of stove herbaceous perennials,
very extensively employed in sub-tropical and other
methods of summer gardening. Flowers spathaceous;
anther attached to the edge of the petal-like filament.
Leaves very ornamental. Few plants are more easily
grown, or more quickly propagated. Seeds of many of
the finer sorts may be bought cheaply from respectable
seedsmen. These should be sown in heat, in February or
March. A warm house or cucumber pit is the best place
for sowing the seeds, which are very hard. If soaked in
tepid water for twenty-four hours, germination will be
materially stimulated. A mixture of sand and leaf mould
is best for them, and a covering of 1¬Ωin. or 2in. of
earth is not excessive. They should be sown thinly, in
pans. As Cannas are gross, and have somewhat brittle
roots in a young state, it is a good plan to sow the seed
singly in small pots. This method preserves all the roots
intact, and prevents any check in potting off or dividing
the plants out of seed pans or boxes. When this is not
done, the plants must be potted off singly, as soon as they
have formed two leaves, 3in. pots being used for the first
shift. The soil can hardly be too rich and porous. Equal
parts rotted dung, loam, and sand, with a little peat, form
a capital mixture for them. The plants must be kept in
a growing temperature of 60deg. or so, during their earlier
stages, and shifted as required into larger pots. Under
proper management, the roots will fill 6in. pots by the
middle or end of May. They ought not to be planted
out till the end of May or the first week in June. Should
fairly rich soil and a sheltered place be selected for them,
they will not only grow, but flower freely during the late
summer and autumn months. Cannas are also very effective
indoors, either for greenhouse or room decoration.
For these purposes they may be grown on in 8in., 10in., or
even 12in., pots, with rich soil, and placed either in a stove,
intermediate house, warm or cool conservatory, window, or
room. Liberal supplies of manure water will be of very
great benefit. Propagation is also effected by means of
divisions; they form a root-stock very like some of the
commoner and more free-growing Irises, each portion of
which, with bud and roots attached, may be converted
into an independent plant. The best mode of procedure
is to divide the root-stock in early spring, when the pieces
may be placed in 4in. pots at once; and, if plunged in a
bottom heat of 60deg. or so, they will quickly resume root
action and grow rapidly. They may also be propagated
by division without bottom heat. Those who grow large
quantities seldom put their plants in pots at all. Stored
in pots or boxes for the winter, they are divided and
placed singly in similar positions in the spring, and transferred
from such vessels into the open air. The best open
site for Cannas is in a sheltered spot, with a good depth
of rich soil, and plenty of moisture. In such a position,
their noble leaves are not so much injured by rough
winds. After flowering, or at the end of the season, they
may be lifted and stored away in boxes, or in pots of
earth, in dry, frost-proof sheds, or under greenhouse stages
during winter. In warm, sheltered situations, with dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
bottoms, they winter safely in the open, provided their
crowns are covered with 1ft. of litter or cocoa fibre refuse.
But where the soil is wet and cold, or the situation bleak
and unprotected, they should be lifted and stored away,
as already described.</p>

<p><strong>CAPPARIDE√Ü.</strong> An order of herbs or shrubs, rarely
trees. Flowers clustered, or solitary; sepals four to
eight, imbricate or valvate; petals four, arranged crosswise,
sometimes, but rarely, five, or eight, rarely absent. Leaves
alternate, very rarely opposite, stipulate or exstipulate.
The order is distributed throughout the tropical and warm
temperate regions of both hemispheres, the frutescent
species being largely represented in America. There are
about twenty-three genera&mdash;the best-known being <em>Capparis</em>,
<em>Cleome</em>, and <em>Crat√¶va</em>&mdash;and about 300 species.</p>

<p><a name="CAPPARIS" id="CAPPARIS"></a><strong>CAPPARIS</strong> (<em>kapparis</em>, old Greek name used by Dioscorides,
from Persian <em>kabar</em>, Capers). Caper-tree. O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>.
<em>Capparide√¶</em>. Greenhouse or stove evergreen shrubs, of
considerable beauty. Calyx four-parted; petals four;
stamens numerous; succeeded by a berry. They thrive
best in a compost of well-drained sandy loam. Cuttings
of ripe shoots will root in sand, under a hand glass, in
moist heat. This genus contains about 120 species, but
it is very doubtful if more than six are to be found under
cultivation in this country.</p>

<p><a name="CAPSICUM" id="CAPSICUM"></a><strong>CAPSICUM</strong> (from <em>kapto</em>, to bite; on account of the
biting heat of the seeds and pericarp). O<span class="smcapa">RD</span>. <em>Solanace√¶</em>.
Shrubs or sub-shrubs, rarely herbs. Peduncles extra-axillary,
one-flowered. Leaves scattered, solitary, or twin,
and quite entire. Many of the species, although possessing
considerable beauty, are but rarely grown, either for
decoration or for the use of their fruit; consequently, we
confine our specific enumeration to the Common Capsicum,
the Bird Pepper or Chili, and the Bell Pepper. The
first two of these have long been in cultivation, for use
either in a green state for pickles and for making Chili
vinegar, or ripened and ground as Cayenne Pepper. Some
sorts are exceedingly ornamental for greenhouse decoration
in winter, if plants are well grown in rather small pots,
and the fruit ripened under glass. The varieties producing
small pods are the hottest, and consequently best suited
for making Cayenne Pepper. These are generally called
Chilies. All other varieties of Capsicum have a more or
less pungent flavour, and those bearing larger pods are
more profitable for use in a green state. The fruits of
all are either red or yellow when ripe, and are of various
sizes and shapes. Some are produced and stand erect on
the upper side of the branches; others hang underneath.
Fig. 364 represents hanging fruits of Long and Round
Capsicums, the shapes of which are produced by both
red and yellow varieties.</p>

<p><em>Cultivation.</em> Being natives of tropical countries, Capsicums
cannot always be depended upon to thoroughly ripen
in the open air; but a good crop of green fruits may
generally be obtained by preparing the plants early in the
season, and planting out in a warm situation.</p>

<p>Sow the seeds in February or early in March, in pots or
pans, placing them in heat; and so soon as the plants are
large enough, pot off singly into 3in. pots, still keeping
them in heat until well rooted. Place them into 6in. or 7in.
pots before they become starved; and gradually harden off
and plant out about 2ft. asunder, in June. The fruits ripen
better if the plants are placed against a south wall and
tacked on to it. The safest plan to obtain a crop of ripe
fruits is to cultivate under glass. Pots of 7in. diameter are
large enough. Rich soil must be used, and any spare frames
are suitable in summer. Plenty of water and frequent
syringings should be applied, as the plants are very liable
to injury from red spider and other insects if this is in any
way neglected. The fruits will keep some time after being
ripe, but are never better than when fresh gathered; they
may, however, be kept on the plants for a considerable
period.</p>

<p><em>Sorts.</em> Chili, Long Red, Long Yellow, Small Red Cayenne,
Round Red, and Round Yellow. Good ornamental varieties
are: Little Gem, a very dwarf variety, of comparatively
recent introduction, covered with small, erect, red pods;
and Prince of Wales, free fruiting, with hanging bright
yellow pods.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
